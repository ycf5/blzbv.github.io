00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
In this lesson, you learned how to write subqueries and use temp tables.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.990
Writing queries like the ones you learned here,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.810
allows you to substantially increase the types of problems you can

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.804
solve and the volume of data you can comfortably work with in SQL.

00:00:13.804 --> 00:00:19.000
In the next lessons, you'll learn a few tools to handle more directed use cases.
