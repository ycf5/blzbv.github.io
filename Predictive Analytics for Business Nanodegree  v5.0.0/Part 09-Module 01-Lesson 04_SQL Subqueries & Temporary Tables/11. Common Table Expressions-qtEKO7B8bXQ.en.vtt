00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
If you have a common table expression or subquery that takes a really long time to run,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.710
you might want to run it as a completely separate query and

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.109
then write it back into the database as it's own table.

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.459
Then, you can simply query the new table as you would any other,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.100
to finish the things you're trying to calculate.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.935
The big benefit to this approach is that you can improve the speed at which you explore.

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:25.289
Let's say you've got a subquery that takes an hour to run,

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.899
and then you've got an outer query that's pretty fast.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.024
If you run both of them every time you want to make a small tweak to the outer query,

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:34.030
you're going to get really frustrated.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.280
Instead, you can run that inner query once and write it to a table,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.039
then iterating on the outer query will be quick and easy.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.420
We'll dig into performance in more depth in later lessons.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.910
For now, we'll focus on writing your subqueries and

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.000
common table expressions into the database as new tables.
