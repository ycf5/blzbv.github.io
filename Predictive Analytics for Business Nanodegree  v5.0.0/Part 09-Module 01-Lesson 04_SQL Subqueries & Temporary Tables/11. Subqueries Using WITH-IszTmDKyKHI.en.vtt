00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
One problem with subqueries is that they can

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.429
make your queries lengthy and difficult to read.

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:09.209
Common Table expressions or CTEs can help break

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.380
your query into separate components so that your query logic is more easily readable.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.260
You can read the subqueries logic on its

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.040
own and then read the final queries logic easily as well.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.899
Let's look back over this example in which we found the average number of events per

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.939
day in each marketing channel.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.600
Let's break the subquery out into

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.760
his own common table expression which we'll create using the WITH command.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:07.140
Here, we're only defining

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.394
this one common table expression but we could theoretically write as many as we want.

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:15.629
We need to define any common table expressions at the beginning of

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:20.060
the query in order to use them in our final query at the bottom.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.465
Each common table expression gets an alias just like a subquery.

00:01:24.465 --> 00:01:27.030
Here, that alias is events.
