00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.310
Now that we're getting to more complex queries using Subqueries,

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:07.309
the classroom workspace may seem a bit cramped.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.504
If you've not already been writing your queries in an editor,

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:13.950
now is a great time to start. Here's my workflow.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.544
You can see over here on the left,

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:20.579
I have my editor open with the subqueries.sql extension.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.299
And then over here on the right, is the classroom,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.620
where I can read the questions and execute my code.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.439
So, now let's take a look at this first question.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.284
It says provide the name of the sales rep in

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:36.709
each region with the largest amount of total USD sales.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.579
In order to solve this problem,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.614
let's first try to pull some of this information together.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:45.375
We can see that the sales rep information exists in this table.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.450
The region information is over here,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.780
and the total amount USD is over here in the orders table.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.270
Therefore we need to join these four tables

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.949
together in order to pull all this information together.

00:00:56.948 --> 00:00:59.599
So, let's go ahead and start.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:30.109
Start with a comment.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:46.289
Okay, so that should

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.625
make it easier to find that stuff when I come back.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:52.424
And let's go ahead and start tackling this problem.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:59.478
So, we want to pool all this information together.

00:01:59.478 --> 00:02:05.677
So, let's go ahead and start with the sales rep table.

00:02:05.677 --> 00:02:11.312
I'll label that with an alias of SR. Let's join the region table,

00:02:11.312 --> 00:02:13.450
I'll label that with an alias of R. We want to

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.854
join this where the primary and foreign keys match,

00:02:15.854 --> 00:02:24.444
and so therefore that's just like SR region ID is equal to r.id.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:29.444
And then if we want to pull the accounts information,

00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:38.192
I'll have an alias of A and we want a sales rep id equal to sr.id.

00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:44.950
And then let's join the orders table and we'll join now

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:52.457
on o.account id equal to a.id.

00:02:52.457 --> 00:02:57.115
Cool. So, now we sort of have all of our information pulled together.

00:02:57.115 --> 00:03:01.000
We can see from the query we're going to need the name of the sales rep,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.310
the region, and then the total amount of sales for each of these reps.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.689
So, let's go ahead and just pull some of that information together.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.525
So, if we pull the sales rep information,

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:20.760
and then we can pull the region information,

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:26.992
and then the orders.

00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:29.615
We want the total amount,

00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:37.275
and we need that basically for each rep we want.

00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:42.155
The sum of this. So, let's just call that total sales.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:47.980
And then we're going to want to group by the things that aren't in our alias.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.590
So, our alias is right here,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.993
and we have these two columns that are outside of it.

00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:54.014
I'll just do One comma two,

00:03:54.014 --> 00:04:02.769
and we might do an order by the third descending let's say.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.430
Let's go ahead and run this,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.125
see what we get.

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:10.969
Cool.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.802
So, it looks like that executed.

00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:15.514
You can see we only got one name column back,

00:04:15.514 --> 00:04:16.849
and that's probably because,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.265
the workspace is confused about having these two columns named the same thing.

00:04:22.264 --> 00:04:24.500
So, let's be more explicit.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.694
Let's just call this rep, name, and region.

00:04:30.694 --> 00:04:37.298
Let's try that again.

00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:38.644
Cool.

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:40.475
So, now we got three of them.

00:04:40.475 --> 00:04:43.470
We have the rep, the region, and the total sales.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.915
But for this question,

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:47.300
we want to provide the name of the sales rep in

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.210
each region with the largest amount of total sales.

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:54.409
So basically, what we want for the Southeast region is we want

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.737
this individual for the Northeast region we want this individual,

00:04:58.737 --> 00:04:59.870
but here we have

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.699
another Southeast region person we don't want them showing up in our table.

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.479
This person should be for the West,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.420
and then any other regions that we have we basically just want that top individual.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.345
So, in order to do this,

00:05:17.345 --> 00:05:21.095
we're going to have to do a tricky join,

00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:25.360
but this is pretty common.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.335
Basically, we have the information from this table and we like that.

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:52.490
So we're going to create a subquery.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.050
And I'm just going to call this t1.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.276
We could probably come up with a better naming convention for that.

00:05:58.276 --> 00:06:02.039
But, we want to pull from t1 and then basically what we want to do,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.110
is we want to select the region.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.725
So, for each region we just want the maximum total sales.

00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:21.689
So, from this table that we just looked at that one exists right here,

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:27.540
we're going to pull the region along with the max total sales for that region.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.035
And because this is already grouped by the individual,

00:06:31.035 --> 00:06:34.740
we're just going to get the max number over here for each region.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.650
So, for Southeast that should just pull this number,

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:40.259
and for Northeast it should just pull this number.

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.459
And for the West,

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:44.324
it should pull this number and then it'll keep looking.

00:06:44.324 --> 00:06:46.349
And then you can see we have this Northeast region,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.195
and so it should just pull this max one,

00:06:48.194 --> 00:06:50.500
and all the rest of these should go away.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.670
Unfortunately, we can't do this all at once,

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.995
because if we group by the individual again,

00:06:56.995 --> 00:06:59.610
the individual along with the region is still

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.074
unique so we'd end up with all of these table values back.

00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:06.254
But if we grew by just the region, and we pull the max,

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:11.153
we should only get the one rep with the maximum amount of sales.

00:07:11.153 --> 00:07:18.314
So, that's what we're going to do in this table.

00:07:18.314 --> 00:07:28.480
So, this is the max sales for the region because we have another aggregate up here,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.569
we're going to need to group by anything that's not in the aggregate.

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:33.298
So, it's just this first thing.

00:07:33.298 --> 00:07:37.709
Well let's go ahead and run this, make sure that it works.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:43.285
Cool. So, now what you're seeing is we have these four regions,

00:07:43.285 --> 00:07:46.540
and I think I said the wrong thing about the Northeast earlier.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.194
We have these four regions each with their max sales,

00:07:49.194 --> 00:07:53.290
and essentially what we want to do is we want to match that back to the original table.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.825
We want to match that to the table that we had before,

00:07:55.824 --> 00:07:59.664
where the regions match as well as where the total sales,

00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:02.360
is equal to the max sales.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.995
So, let's go ahead and do that.

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:06.069
So, we have this table,

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.964
that's this one that exists over here on the right now.

00:08:09.964 --> 00:08:12.174
So, we're going to take that and we'll just,

00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:17.912
again I'm just going to call it T2.

00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:23.370
So let's pull from that.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.625
And we want to join on this table down here.

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:33.850
So, we're going to join on this table down here.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.615
And I'll just stay that's with t3.

00:08:37.615 --> 00:08:40.878
So, basically this table right here is t2.

00:08:40.878 --> 00:08:43.525
T3 was the table that we executed earlier,

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:46.569
and we want to join where this max sales

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.420
is equal to the sales that we saw in that earlier table,

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:51.219
and then pull both the region,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.529
and the rep from the join.

00:08:56.529 --> 00:08:58.129
So let's select.

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:02.004
And essentially it really doesn't matter where we pull the region,

00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:04.894
or whether we pull max sales, or total sales.

00:09:04.894 --> 00:09:08.053
The really important part here is the join portion.

00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:13.029
So, from t2 we could pull the region name,

00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:18.750
and from t2 we could also pull the max sales,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.576
and then from t3 we need to pull the rep name.

00:09:23.576 --> 00:09:30.240
I'm just going to put that first.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.164
Okay.

00:09:32.164 --> 00:09:35.389
So, here we have the three parts that we need to pull,

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:42.314
and then the important part here is how we join these two tables together.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:45.645
So, we have this table up here that has the region name,

00:09:45.644 --> 00:09:50.615
and the max sales for a particular rep,

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:54.086
and now essentially what we want to do is we want to join that.

00:09:54.086 --> 00:10:02.694
So, we want to join on the region name equal to the other region name.

00:10:02.695 --> 00:10:10.004
And we want the max sales in t2

00:10:10.004 --> 00:10:18.033
to be equal to the total sales in t3.

00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:23.200
So, if the regions match then we know that we're looking at the right region.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.645
And if the max sales is equal to the total sales,

00:10:25.644 --> 00:10:29.350
then that means that the max sales is equal

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:34.284
to the sales that we saw for a particular rep in this first table.

00:10:34.284 --> 00:10:37.360
So, it'll only pull essentially

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.705
the sales representatives who have sales that are equal to these amounts,

00:10:43.705 --> 00:10:45.810
and where they are in this region.

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:49.689
So basically, as you can see the Southeast has the highest.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.790
So, maybe there is somebody in the Southeast who has this.

00:10:52.789 --> 00:10:55.314
And if we didn't match on this region here,

00:10:55.315 --> 00:11:01.453
then potentially there could be multiple with the max sales that we have in the Midwest,

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.366
but it's not the max for that region,

00:11:03.366 --> 00:11:04.704
this is the max for that region.

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:08.960
So, we can match on both the region and the sales amount.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:15.556
Cool. So, let's go ahead and run this.

00:11:15.556 --> 00:11:18.759
Okay.

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:21.480
So, it looks like we got four results.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.700
We have the Southeast, the Northeast,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.855
the West, and the Midwest,

00:11:24.855 --> 00:11:25.980
and nothing else is showing there.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.500
So there are those four regions.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.029
And here's essentially the max amount of sales

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:33.789
by a particular rep and then the name of that representative.
