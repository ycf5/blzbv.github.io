Some queries, also known as inner queries or nested queries,

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:08.099
are a tool for performing operations in multiple steps.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.969
For example, let's put our marketing manager hats back on.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.890
We'd like to know which channels send

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.880
the most traffic per day on average to Patch and Posey.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:22.884
In order to do that, we'll need to aggregate events by channel by day,

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:26.820
then we need to take those and average them.
