00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
At this point, you've learned all the basics.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.724
You understand database structure,

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:08.314
and generally know how to access information.

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:11.570
You can even do some simple aggregations.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.830
There are a few things left to learn that will make you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.714
able to solve any problem you're confronted with.

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:21.655
In this lesson, you're going to learn how to query from the results of another query.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.775
This allows you to build more transformations into your query,

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.559
organize work more easily,

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.419
and even make your queries run faster.
