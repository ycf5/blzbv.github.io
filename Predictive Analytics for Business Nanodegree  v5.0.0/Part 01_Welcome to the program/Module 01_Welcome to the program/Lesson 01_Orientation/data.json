              "text": "## Frequently asked questions specific to the Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree Program\n\n##### What internet browser should I use?\n\nWe highly recommend using **Google Chrome** or **Firefox**, you may experience issues downloading files if you use Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge \n\n##### When I go to download files, I experience difficulties. How do I resolve this? \n\nPlease make sure you are using the latest version of Google Chrome. Please right click on your mouse and click \"Save As...\". From there you should be able to save your files with the format of your choice. \n\n##### When will I get the Alteryx/Tableau license?\n\nYou will receive your Alteryx and Tableau licenses within a few business days of finishing your free trial. We send out licenses every Monday and Thursday.\n\n##### How long are the Alteryx/Tableau licenses good for?\n\nBoth licenses last for 6 months, which should be plenty of time to finish the program. If the program takes you longer, you may request an extension as long as you’ve demonstrated significant progress in the program. The licenses are educational licenses, so they should not be used for commercial purposes. \n\n##### What if I need technical help with Alteryx or Tableau?\n\nPlease use Student Hub or Knowledge for technical help. Other students have likely had the same questions. If you are unable to get answers, then email bizanalyst-support@udacity.com. Please do not go to the Alteryx or Tableau support websites except as a last resort.\n\n##### Can I use other software besides Alteryx for my analysis?\n\nYou are welcome to use any software you wish, but keep in mind that we won’t be able to provide help with other tools outside the ones used in the Nanodegree program.\n\n##### Do I need a Windows Operating system to take this program? Can I take this program if I have a Macintosh computer?\n\nThe Alteryx software requires a Windows operating system. You are welcome to use other analytical software, but it will not be supported in the program. If you have a Mac, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xc29uP7AFw) explains what to do to run Windows on a Mac. So you can then install Alteryx on your computer.",

You **DO NOT** need to use Alteryx until about halfway through the **Linear Regression** lesson. In the concept called \"Download Alteryx,\" you'll receive instructions on how to download and install Alteryx. It's important that you refer to those instructions. Please do not email our support team until you do so.\n\nYou will need a Windows OS to install Alteryx on to. If you are using a Mac, you will need to install Parallels or partition your hard drive.\n\nVideo on how to partition your hard drive: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xc29uP7AFw",

It's the free version that doesn't connect to as many data sources as the personal or professional versions, but it's more than capable to do most work with. It can read data from text (CSV) files and Excel files which you'll be using in this course. Also, you can't save to workbooks on your computer, but instead save to a public workbook. You can then download the workbook from there, so it isn't much of an issue.\n\n#### Time to install\n\nGo to https://public.tableau.com/s/, should look like this:",
