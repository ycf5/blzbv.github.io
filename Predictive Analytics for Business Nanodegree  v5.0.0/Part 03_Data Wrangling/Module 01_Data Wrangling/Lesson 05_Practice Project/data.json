This next section includes a practice project that can help you assess how ready you are for the actual project that you will submit for review. Rather than submitting this project, you can self assess by looking at a sample solution, a solution Alteryx workflow, and/or a detailed walk-through. Do your best to do it on your own, but don't hesitate to use the resources provided when you get stuck. \n\nGood luck!\n\nSam and Mark",

This way they’ll have a good estimation of how well a school is managing its costs relative to what the model would predict. You’ve been asked to to prepare the data for modelling.\n#### Data Understanding\nYou’ve been given four CSV files that contain data for two different school districts. You can find these files at the bottom of the page.\n\n* DistrictA_Attendance - This file contains average daily attendance, percent attendance, and pupil-teacher ratio data for the 25 schools in district A.\n* DistrictA_Finance - This file contains average monthly teacher salary and per pupil cost data for the 25 schools in district A.\n* DistrictB_Attendance - This file contains average daily attendance, percent attendance, and pupil-teacher ratio data for the 21 schools in district B.\n* DistrictB_Finance - This file contains average monthly teacher salary and per pupil cost data for the 21 schools in district B.\n\n#### Data Preparation\n\n##### Step 1: Combine the data\nFirst you’ll need to combine the data from the various files into one sheet, with one row per school. To do this, you’ll use the skills you learned in the Formatting Data and Blending Data lessons. \n\n##### Step 2: Clean the Data\nNext you’ll clean the data, which includes addressing duplicate data, missing data, and any other data issues. To do this, you’ll use the skills you learned in the Data Issues lesson.\n\n##### Step 3: Identify and Deal with Outliers\nLastly, you’ll look for outliers and determine the best way to address them. To do this, you’ll use the skills you learned in the Data Issues lesson.\n\n### Self-Assessment \nDo your best to complete the practice project on your own. Once you are done, or get stuck, take a look at the solution. We’ve provided the solution dataset, Alteryx workflow, as well as a walk through of how to complete the project. There's not necessarily one perfectly right answer.\n",

              "text": "### Identifying and dealing with outliers\n\n*We are working on providing more detail to this section. In the meantime, here's an overview.*\n\nTo check for outliers, let’s start with some scatterplots to visualize the relationship between each predictor variable and the target variable. Since there are four predictor variables, let’s drag in four scatterplot tools, and connect them to the cleaned dataset. Then we configure each one with a different predictor variable, attach browse tools, and run the workflow.\n\nLet’s start with attendance. The box and whisker plots on either axis use the interquartile range to determine whether a point is an outlier. You can see here there are two dramatic outliers for attendance, so let’s address those first, then come back to the others. \n\nFor these outliers, it looks like the data may not be recorded properly. Let’s look at the observations by attaching a sort tool and browse tool to the dataset. You can see that almost every observation has a decimal, and these two observations seem to be about 10X the average, so it’s highly likely that the data is an error and we should divide by 10. Normally we would validate with the source, but for now we’ll just make the assumption. I’ll use a formula tool to filter out these records, and create another scatter plot.\n\n**ATTENDANCE**: There still is one more outlier. For this one, it seems like the data is probably right, and it’s just a larger school. My concern with keeping this observation is that it may skew the data, creating or masking a relationship with PPC.  If I knew that none of the schools I was predicting for were going to be that size, I’d delete it. Otherwise, I’d keep it in. Let’s plan on building a model with and without this variable.\n\n**PERCENT ATTENDANCE**: Now let’s look at percent attendance. There doesn’t appear to be outliers. Great.\n\n**PUPIL TEACHER RATIO**: For Pupil Teacher Ratio, there are 2 outliers, which are also outliers for PPC. This makes sense since we’d expect the relationship to behave this way. Based on the fitted line, the outliers are in line with the relationship, so we’d leave them in.\n\n**TEACHER SALARIES**: Two records are outliers, with very low salaries. Just like for PTR, these seem to be in line with the trend, and not dramatically different, so it’s probably best to keep them in.\n\nNOTE: In this example, because of the small size of the dataset, we could look at each outlier and make decisions. For larger data sets, you’d likely have to make more systematic decisions, such as removing all outliers, or removing the top 1 or 2 percent of observations for each variable.\n\n#### Outlier Summary \nSo, we kept 4 of the 5 outliers, and we’ll run the model with and without the fifth one. So now we are ready for modeling. Nice work.\n\n##### How to deal with outliers\n\nAs a reminder, let’s quickly review how to handle an outlier. There are three main methods: \n1. Delete: When data is erroneous or when the outlier hurts the model's ability to make predictions (perhaps the value is very unlikely to appear again so keeping it in the model will skew all other predictions).\n2. Impute: Also for when data is erroneous, we could use the average or median value in its place.\n3. Leave it: If the data is good data, it may be best to leave the data in and try with and without it to see the difference.\n",
