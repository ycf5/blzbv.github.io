In the first part, you will blend and format data and deal with outliers.\n\nFor the second part, you will use your cleaned up dataset to create another linear regression model. The difference this time is that you will have to choose which variable(s) are the most important for the model using new techniques learned in the Selecting Predictor Variables section.\n\n### Scenario\n\nPawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state.  This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. Your manager has asked you to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacity’s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.\n\n#### How Do I Complete this Project?\n\nThis project uses skills learned throughout the \"Data Preparation” lessons. To complete this project:\n\n* Go through the course.\n* Apply the skills learned in the course to solve the business problem given in the project details. \n* Use our guidelines and rubric to help build your project.\n* When you're ready, submit it to us for review using the submission template found in the supporting materials section.\n\n#### Skills Required\n\nIn order to complete this project, you must be able to:\n\n* Understand different data types. Review Lesson 1 Understanding Data\n* Deal with a variety of data issues. Review Lesson 2 Data Issues\n* Format data appropriately. Review Lesson 3 Data Formatting\n* Blend data together using joins and unions. Review Lesson 4 Data Blending",

Every row should have sales data because we're trying to predict sales.\n\n**Notes**\n\nYou should be consolidating the data at the city level and **not at the store level.** We only have data at the city wide level so any analysis at the store level will not be sufficient to complete this analysis. \n\nWe simply need to focus on cleaning up and blending the data together in this step.\n\nIf you’ve done everything correctly, the sum for each of the above columns should be:\n\n- **Census Population:** 213,862\n- **Total Pawdacity Sales:** 3,773,304\n- **Households with Under 18:** 34,064\n- **Land Area:** 33,071\n- **Population Density:** 63\n- **Total Families:** 62,653\n\nwith **11 rows of data**\n\nFor Alteryx users:\n\n* Use the Autofield Tool to help quickly convert your data fields into the appropriate datafields for analysis.\n\n* Research these [three specific formulas](http://help.alteryx.com/10.6/index.htm#Reference/Functions.htm#String) to help you get rid of unwanted characters in the Formula tool: ReplaceFirst, Left, FindString\n\n#### Step 3: Dealing with Outliers\n\nOnce you have created the dataset, look for outliers and figure out how deal with your outliers. Use the IQR method to determine if there are outlier cities for each of the variables and then justify which city that has at least one outlier value should be removed.\n\n**IQR Steps**\n\nTo calculate the upper fence and the lower fence, here are the exact steps:\n\n1 . Calculate 1st quartile Q1 and 3rd quartile Q3 of the dataset. You can use the Excel function QUARTILE.INC or QUARTILE.EXC\n\n2 . Calculate the Interquartile Range: IQR = Q3 - Q1\n\n3 . Add 1.5 * IQR to Q3 to get the upper fence: Upper Fence = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\n\n4 . Subtract 1.5 * IQR to Q1 to get the lower fence: Lower Fence = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\n\n5 . Values above the Upper Fence and values below the Lower Fence are outliers\n",
