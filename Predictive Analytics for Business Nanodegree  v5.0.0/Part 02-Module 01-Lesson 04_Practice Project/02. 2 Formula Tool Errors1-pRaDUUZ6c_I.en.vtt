00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.065
Hi, we're back with some more walkthroughs of typical Alteryx errors.

00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:12.645
So, in this one, we are going to actually try and recreate the linear regression formula

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:19.515
using the linear regression tool from the old diamond dataset from the first project.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.905
So, first off, if we just connect it

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:26.700
straight from diamonds to the linear regression model,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.220
you can see an error already pops up,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.390
saying at least one predictor variable must be selected.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.645
So, if we just go ahead and select the ones that are in that formula,

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:41.390
so now we have a few,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.155
it says no valid fields were selected.

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.410
We haven't selected target variable yet,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.440
but it doesn't seem to let us, which seems odd.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.800
So, what's going on here?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.115
If we try and run it,

00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:58.545
it just errors out on us.

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:04.099
The first thing we should always jump to is popping

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.875
in both a browse tool to the data and the select tool.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:14.330
This both gives us the visibility into the data if we run this again

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.200
really quickly to see what's going on?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.835
What does our data look like?

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:22.670
The select tool helps us check on the data type

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.550
which is typically what is triggering errors.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.540
So, here again, we have to select the proper datatypes.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.570
So, let's go ahead and select double for all of the pieces of our formula,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.330
and make this a little bigger,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.695
so you can see all these.

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.220
All right. So, if we run this again,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.705
it automatically selected carat,

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:49.470
which is not the target variable we want.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.230
We wanted it to break price,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.000
but it won't let us select that.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.710
Now, another reason it won't let as select that is because

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.030
the linear regression tool is expecting a numerical variable for its target variable.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.035
If we look back at the select tool,

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:08.449
our price field here is still labeled as a V string.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:13.044
So, if we update this field as well to be a double,

00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:15.620
go back in linear regression tool,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.470
now we can select price.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.715
If we add a Browse tool here to the report, it should run,

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:26.625
linear regression takes a minute for it to run,

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:30.015
but we're not getting any errors which is good news.

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:32.960
You might see this often as well that

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.350
some invalid name has been replaced by something so,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.590
in this instance, it's referring to that there's no model name here.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.080
So, if we just fill this out,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.085
that's going to remove that warning.

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:49.910
You can also get this warning when it comes to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.050
the titles of the fields which we'll get into a little bit later.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.740
So, if you can see here,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.620
this is producing that formula that we gave you guys,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.625
it's actually a little bit different.

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:05.285
I think that's some rounding issues,

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:09.260
but it's essentially the same estimates,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.005
coefficient estimates for each of the variables.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:15.830
Now, we're going to try and apply

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.605
the Score tool to another dataset and see how that works.

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:25.010
All right, let me grab this.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.450
So, the Score tool basically takes the linear regression formula,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.350
and it allows you to apply it to another dataset,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.290
so we're going to input.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.380
So, I actually made

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.940
some specific diamond datasets that try and show you what all can go wrong.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.250
So, we're going to go ahead and run this and see what happens.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.355
Okay. So, we got a error here.

00:03:56.355 --> 00:04:03.765
Now, you can be confused because again it seemed like you had everything set up right,

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:05.350
but if you look down here,

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.680
it's saying that the variables carat,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.335
cut_ord, clarity_ord are missing from the input data stream.

00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:15.465
That's typically referring to this new dataset,

00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:18.425
but if you look at it, it looks like it has carat,

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:23.930
cut_ord, and clarity_ord, but if you look a little bit closer,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.130
the difference is there's no underscores here where there are underscores here.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.870
So, it's a small thing,

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.740
but it's something that will mess Alteryx up and something you have to fix.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.950
So, the Select tool is great for fixing that.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.685
So, if we rename this so that it matches exactly

00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:48.945
with the field name from the original dataset.

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:52.435
So, you also need to, again,

00:04:52.435 --> 00:04:55.540
assign these the same datatypes,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.575
or we'll do one where I don't assign one of them,

00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:01.605
so we can see what happens.

00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:05.075
Okay. So, if the datatype doesn't match,

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:08.515
you're going to get this other error where it's saying

00:05:08.515 --> 00:05:13.295
basically that the datatypes don't match up.

00:05:13.295 --> 00:05:16.760
So, if you don't make sure that all

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.695
of the datatypes and the field names don't match exactly,

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.150
you're gonna get a error,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.790
and this is true for a lot of the tools inside of Alteryx.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.010
So, you got to pay attention to

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.180
those details and look what the Select tool, what's going on.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.685
But, now with this one,

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:39.670
now that we've fixed all those datatype issues and the field name issues,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.840
we should get through it without any errors.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.370
It's all right. Awesome. Now, that's

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.810
it for this video and we're going to talk through one more issue in the next.
