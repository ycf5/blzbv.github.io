00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
So, we're here to show you one other common thing that

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.585
triggers most of the Alteryx errors which is null values.

00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:16.235
So, depending if you're using 10.6,

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:21.325
which is the version of Alteryx we recommend or if you're using 11,

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:24.514
it will impact different tools differently.

00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:28.050
So, I'm not going to walk through so many specific examples so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.025
much as how to identify if you have them or not.

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:34.050
So, the easiest way to do that,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.180
as you can see I call this Bad Diamond Data because I made it to have some null values,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.320
is to add a field summary tool.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.464
So, anytime you're running into errors,

00:00:45.464 --> 00:00:47.600
beyond just adding a browse tool,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.120
sometimes adding a field summary tool right

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.535
before some amount of data is going into a tool,

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:58.850
you can attach a field summary tool.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.895
Make sure you select all the fields you can,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:06.675
and then oops, I need to add in all of the browsers,

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:09.180
and then we're going to run that workflow.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.500
So, in this view,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.870
you can see whenever there's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.954
a little bit of red that shows you that there's something missing.

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:26.230
Now, that can trigger a whole bunch of errors for you with really crazy names down here.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.780
So, if you look in this one,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.795
you can see it as well.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.055
It'll show you the percentage missing,

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:35.990
so let's just add actually a browse tool to the data and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.270
see if we can just see one do so we know that it looks like.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.270
So, if we pull this up a bit, scroll down.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.445
So anytime you see this null here, this bracketed null,

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:52.285
those are missing values,

00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:59.290
and that will mess up many of the tools especially if you are using 11.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.285
So, ways to deal with that,

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:09.940
you can use the filter tool which will allow you to pick a field.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.675
So, if we look back here,

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:18.710
we know that carat is a null value for row 15 as well as 19,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.325
19 has them all.

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:22.380
So, we can pick a field,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.955
say something like carat,

00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:28.775
and we can actually say, is not null.

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:32.515
So that means everything in the true when we run this,

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:35.185
now 15, it isn't there anymore.

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:36.250
If we look in the faults,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.230
we can see those two records that did contain nulls filtered out.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.205
That's one of the ways you can deal with it.

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:51.315
Another way which we'll cover more in depth when you should do it is impute it,

00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:53.745
which again this will be covered later in the course.

00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:55.495
But basically, this says,

00:02:55.495 --> 00:02:57.990
anytime that you see a null value,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.250
you can replace with the average median mode or you can even set a number,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.945
but this was another way to basically

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:12.030
replace anytime that you see a null with a specific value.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.675
The last way that I would recommend dealing with nulls is

00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:24.310
the data cleansing tool which will replace your nulls with

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.780
either blanks for string fields and zeros for numeric fields.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.455
This will depend on the data types you have coming into the tool.

00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:35.080
So, remember, right now,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.095
since we haven't put in a select tool,

00:03:37.095 --> 00:03:38.560
if you did this,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.230
you would get blanks and not zeros for these null values that should be number.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.665
So, make sure you use your select tool prior to using

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:54.860
the data cleansing tool or actually even using the impute tool. Thank you.
