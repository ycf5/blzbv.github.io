00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's look at how to
transpose data in Alteryx.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.469
When we look at the data,

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:09.740
we can see that sales are shown
in six different fields by month.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.780
We're going to take these six fields,
and put them all into one sales field.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.660
To do this, we drag in the transpose
tool from the transform category.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.580
Notice how the tool image itself
is showing you the before and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.400
after of the data.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.013
We're going to go from wide to long.

00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:33.790
The key field which is the field
that is not going to be transposed,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.422
is the product field.

00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:39.340
While all the rest of the fields
remain checked in the data fields.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.820
When we run the workflow, we can see
that 3 records turn into 18 records.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.260
There were three records initially.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260
With six fields of data.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.550
So when we transpose the data
this becomes 18 records of data.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.320
Each initial record is now
represented by six records.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.060
One for each month.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.720
So when we transpose the data,
it creates two fields.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.820
One is name or the name of
the field the data came from.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.370
And value, which is the sales value.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.630
We can use the select tool to change
the field called value to sales.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420
And then the field called name to date.
