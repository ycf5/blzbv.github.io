00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.350
Another way that you can consume data is
through a cross-tabulation, or Crosstab.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.870
A Crosstab allows you to take
data within a field, and

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.390
summarize other data to the values
within that field to create a matrix.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.300
Let's look at where we might use this.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.200
If I have a file of schools in Wyoming,
and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.420
I'm putting together a data
set at the zip code level,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.960
then I'll need to summarize the schools'
data at the zip code level.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.950
I can do simple counts
of school records or

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.580
sums of enrollment by aggregating, or
summarizing at the zip code level.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.140
However, if I wanted to
create new fields for

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.310
each value of the level description,
or level desk field,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.130
and sum up the number of records
in my data set, by zip code,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.120
for each of those values,
like other, high, primary, and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.870
so on, then I would need to create
a cross tabulation of this data.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.200
This sort of action can be done
similarly in a pivot table in Excel.
