00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.680
In this section, we'll learn about
aggregating or summarizing data.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.940
For example, you might want to summarize
transactional data that list each

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.749
product sold within one
transaction as separate records.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.790
So if you wanted to calculate
the total sale of a transaction,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.560
you'd need to sum up the products
within each transaction.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.980
Or maybe you want to count
the number of tweets associated

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.850
with a store location
in a particular month.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.630
Then you'd need to count these
up within that time frame.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.800
If we think back to the example
mentioned at the beginning of

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.700
the lesson,
we have daily sales data, and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.310
we want to build a forecasting
model to forecast monthly sales.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.260
Then the data going into the model is
going to need to be aggregated, so

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.600
that each record represents
a monthly value.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.720
If you were going to summarize
this data by month in Excel,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.060
you'd need to create a pivot
table from the daily sales data.
