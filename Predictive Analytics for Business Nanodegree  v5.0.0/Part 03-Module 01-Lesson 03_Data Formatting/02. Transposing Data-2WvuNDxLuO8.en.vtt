00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.120
Earlier I mentioned massaging data.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.050
But what does that really mean?

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.670
Here's a data set with products listed
along the left as individual records and

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.280
months of the year along the top.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.030
In each of the cells are the sales for
each month for each product.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.822
But what if we needed all
the sales values in one field?

00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:25.179
We would need to pivot the orientation
of the data for all the months so

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.150
that it will display lengthwise.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.060
This is called transposing.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.650
And the concept is somewhat similar to
what you can do in Excel in a pivot

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.850
table.
