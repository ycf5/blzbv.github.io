00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.870
To solve for

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.520
this question, we only need to use one
tool in addition to the input data tool.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.560
We simply connect the cross
tab tool to the input data.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.951
The field that we're
grouping by is the city,

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:19.664
because the records will
be each of the cities.

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:21.295
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:25.545
The new column headers
will be the school types,

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:30.010
so we choose type,
description, or type, desk.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.360
The values in the columns
will be the enrollment, and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.390
since we're looking to summarize
the enrollments by city and

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.370
type, we choose sum as the method.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.641
When we run the workflow,

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:52.329
[SOUND] you can see that the school
types are listed across the top.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.565
Regular, special ed, vocational,
tech, and other, and

00:00:56.565 --> 00:01:00.130
the cities are the individual records.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.750
With the sum of the enrollment
by city and by type.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.160
If we filter the city field for
Laramie, we can see that

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.980
the number of enrollments for
Laramie that are vocational,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.169
technical, and other, is 141.
