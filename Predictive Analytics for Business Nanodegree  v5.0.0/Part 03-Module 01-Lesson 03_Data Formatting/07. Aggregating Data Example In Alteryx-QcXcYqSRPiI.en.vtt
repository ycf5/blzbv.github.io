00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's explore how to do this in Altrix.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.610
We're starting with daily sales data,
that runs from January 1,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.410
2015 to December 31, 2015, and

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.150
we want to aggregate the sales value for
each month.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.580
When we look at the data,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.750
we can see that the date field is in
a date format not a string format.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.100
This is important to recognize, because
if we want to aggregate by month,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.650
then we need to create a new
field that has the month in it,.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.010
Then we simply use the values in that
new field, to group the data by.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.380
We can easily create a month
field by using the formula tool.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.750
Make sure to change
the type to a string.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.287
Go down to the functions,
choose Date/Time, and

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:46.920
we'll use the Date/Time format function.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.087
If we browse through the help,
going to the Functions &amp;gt; Date/Time,

00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:58.105
we can find information
around that Date/Time format,

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:02.388
and find the format string
that we need to pull out

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:06.491
the three character
month value which is %b.

00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:09.768
So going back to the workflow,

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:14.430
where it says dt we put
in the field date, and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.250
where it says f we replace
this with "%b" in quotes.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.800
We can see the month value
appearing in this field.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.030
Then we can add the summarize
tool to aggregate the data

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.809
to the new month field, and
sum up the sales values.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.520
However, when we run this, we see that
the data is sorted by month name, so

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.180
the months don't appear
in their calendar order.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.510
To fix this,
we'll go back to the formula tool and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.660
add one more month field,
that represents the month as a number.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.120
We'll use the same function again, but

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.270
this time we'll use % lower case
m to pull out the month number.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.610
When we add this to
our summarize tool and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.190
move it to the top, the data will now
be sorted in calendar month format.
