00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.910
In our last lesson,
we learned how to identify and

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.510
clean up dirty data as we build
up our optimal analytic data set.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.100
However, once the data is clean it
might not be properly formatted for

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.510
us to use in building models.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.360
For instance, we might want to build a
model forecasting product sales by month

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.290
over the next six months.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.900
If the data we have available
is daily product sales,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.210
than we're going to need to sum
this daily data up for each month.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.050
That's one example of formatting data.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.180
In this lesson,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.880
we will cover how to identify when your
data needs to be formatted differently.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.300
And how to massage the data or
arrogate it to the form required.
