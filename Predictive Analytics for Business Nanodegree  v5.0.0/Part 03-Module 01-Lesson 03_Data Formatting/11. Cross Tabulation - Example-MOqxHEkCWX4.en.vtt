00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.440
Let's try cross-tabing in Alteryx.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.990
But before we do this,
let's count the schools by zip code and

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.770
level description to see what that
would look like in the summarize tool.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.840
When we look at the result,
we can see that the data

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.740
is showing counts of schools by
zip code and by level description.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.700
But what we're trying to achieve is
to create new fields out of the level

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.750
description values that count
the number of schools in each

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.021
of those categories by zip code.

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.723
To do this,
we'll use the cross-tab tool.

00:00:33.723 --> 00:00:34.643
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:34.643 --> 00:00:39.980
After attaching the cross-tab tool,
we'll set it up.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.400
The group data by these
values represents what we

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.200
want to see at the record level.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.170
In this case, it's zip codes.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
The new column headers represents
the fields that will be

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.590
created from the values
in that column of data.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.890
So if we want to see one field for

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.848
each level description,
then we select LevelDesk here.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.710
Next, in the values for new columns,
we need to select a numeric field so

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.990
account can be generated for
each of the records.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.030
We'll select Enrollment.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.690
In the method for aggregating values,
we'll select Count [without Nulls],

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.440
which counts the number of
records without null values.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.410
The end result have the level
descriptions listed across the top and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.530
the zip codes along the side, along with

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.430
the individual counts of schools that
fall in each of these categories.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.220
We can easily remove the count
prefix in the Select tool.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.410
We select the fields that we
want to remove the prefix for.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.880
Go to Options &amp;gt; Remove Prefix, and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.609
select Remove "Count_".

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.727
When we run the workflow, [SOUND],

00:01:57.727 --> 00:02:01.679
we can see that that word count
has been removed from the fields.

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.129
