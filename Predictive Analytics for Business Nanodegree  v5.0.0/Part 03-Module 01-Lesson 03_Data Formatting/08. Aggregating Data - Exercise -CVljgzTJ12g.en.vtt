00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.820
Now's your turn to use
Alteryx to aggregate data.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.850
You're going to work with
a file of Wyoming schools.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.850
If you're not familiar with Wyoming,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.520
it's a state in
the United States of America.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.610
It's known for the beautiful Yellowstone
National Park, which is famous for

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.590
a geyser called Old Faithful,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.110
that erupts with water in
the air every few hours.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.400
Now that you have a feel for

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.020
where Wyoming is,
let's get back to the exercise.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.731
Taking the Wyoming school's sample file,
found in the notes below the video,

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:33.060
summarize the school data by zip code.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.153
And count the total school
enrollment by zip code.

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:39.809
And count the number of
schools in each zip code.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.867
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:48.220
What is the total enrollment
in zip code 82009?
