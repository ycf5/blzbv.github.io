00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.425
In this lesson, we've covered
transposing, aggregating, and

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:09.580
cross-tabbing data to format it so
it's now more useful for analysis.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.940
We're almost done.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.360
But, in reality, we don't always
have just one data set to work with.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.590
We're usually blending data
from multiple sources.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.690
So let's now explore the next step
in building our analytic data set

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.990
through data blending techniques.
