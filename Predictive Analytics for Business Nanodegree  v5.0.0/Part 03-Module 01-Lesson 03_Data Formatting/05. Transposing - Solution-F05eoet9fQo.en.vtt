00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.820
To solve for this exercise,
we transpose the data

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.990
making sure to select both product and
category as the key fields.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.430
And then all of the months
become the data fields.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.710
To ensure that we're doing
the summarization for January and

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.660
February only,
we attach a filter tool and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.590
filter out the records where the month
is equal to either January or February.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.000
I can start building the expression
by using the basic filter and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.930
then click on the custom filter
to add in the second month.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.497
Feel free to use copy paste
in the expression area.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.160
Next, we attach the summarize tool.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.620
We're going to group by both product and
category.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.124
And then sum up the value field,
which represents the sales.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.350
From here, we can see that the sales for
encyclopedias for January and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.635
February combined is a 125,452.
