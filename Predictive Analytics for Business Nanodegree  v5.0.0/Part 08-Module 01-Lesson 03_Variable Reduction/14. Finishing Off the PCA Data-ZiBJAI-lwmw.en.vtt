00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.059
If you've completed
the previous quiz successfully,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.240
you should now have an Altryx workflow
that looks something similar to this.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.769
You would have used
three other PCA tools.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.070
One for rain, one for snow,
and one for precipitation.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.060
To quickly go through the configuration
for each, as you can see, for the rain,

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.529
you would have picked
the 12 rain variables.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.500
I chose to append 4
principle components.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.769
For snow, you would have
picked the snow variables.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.000
And I chose to append 2
principal components because

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.539
most of the variance was maintained and
captured in only the first two.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.179
One thing to note on
the snow PCA process,

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.829
I did not select to scale the data.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.439
This is a case where
the data doesn't alow for

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:57.339
scaling because all the values for
snow fall in July are zero.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.550
The scaling process doesn't work and
would throw an error.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.530
For precipitation,
I picked the precipitation months and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.049
chose to append four
principal components.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.500
What you need to do now,
is to get all of the necessary data

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.099
into one dataset to use in
the cluster analysis process.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:21.619
This can be done by joining them
together with a Join Multiple tool.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.312
To simplify creating
the rest of the workflow,

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:26.674
which is more about the Alteryx process.

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:31.509
I've built out a complete workflow
that shows how you would do this.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.390
You can download the complete
workflow from the instructor notes.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.753
If you want to get more
familiar with Alteryx,

00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:41.646
I'd encourage you to work through
the configuration for each of the tools.

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:45.085
I have saved the results of
the process to a yxdb file,

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:49.839
which is an Alteryx format that
will retain the numeric data types.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.329
This is in the instructor notes as well.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.549
This file can be used as a starting
point for the next part of the exercise.
