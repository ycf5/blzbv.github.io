00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.439
So as we think back to
the purpose of PCA,

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:07.910
it is to decrease a large number
of variables to just a few.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.740
In the case of temperature, we've taken
12 variables and basically reduced it to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.740
one, since it contains about 92% of
all the variance of all 12 variables.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.309
We might choose to keep PC2 in the mix.

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:25.849
And then it's just two variables that
represent all of the temperature data.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.350
One thing to remember is that since
these actual component variables

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.640
are really a mashed up representation
of all the temperature variables,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.490
you really can't relate the values
to actual temperatures directly.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.620
But we've seen that even though we may
not be able to interpret the results on

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:50.509
a number by number basis,
as a whole, the results make sense.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.674
PC1, and possibly PC2,
should allow us to incorporate

00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:59.859
the temperature effect of climate
onto our cluster modelling process.
