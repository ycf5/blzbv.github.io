00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.850
let's look at an example of
using variable reduction.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.089
Say we are analyzing an employee
survey where the employee has to rate

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.890
with the response from one to seven,
the following questions.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.990
My boss treats me with consideration.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.250
My boss gives me recognition
when I do a good job.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.350
My boss consults me when there
are decisions to be made about my work.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.260
Now, in reality,
these are all similar and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.149
could probably be categorized as
employee satisfaction with supervisor.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.310
An analyst could choose
to leave them all in,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.829
but again, if they're already dealing
with a number of other variables,

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.210
it might make it simpler to
just have a single variable

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.770
that captures most of the variance in
the response of these three variables.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.609
Again, much easier to communicate
the concept of employee satisfaction

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.939
than to identify each
questions results separately.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.370
One negative aspect to variable
reduction is that while it does reduce

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.670
the number of variables in the analysis,
depending on the method used in

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.590
the data, it can make the interpretation
of the model more difficult.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.870
If the variables you are combining
aren't necessarily related, for

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.810
example, population totals and
income levels,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.560
the component variables that
are created might be hard to explain.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.900
It's a good practice to try
to use variable reduction

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.780
when the variables are somewhat related.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.040
We see this in the example data we built
out in the exercise from the previous

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.230
lesson.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.520
We have 12 months each of temperature,
snowfall, rain and precipitation data.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.959
I wouldn't want to use variable
reduction methods to combine all 48

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.786
variables at once, but it would make
sense to create component variables for

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:53.510
each category of climate.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.939
This way, snowfall is kept
separate from temperature.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.280
So, as an analyst, you need to weight
the benefit you can get from reducing

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.810
the number of variables you use in
the clustering analysis, with the all

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.500
important aspect of needing to be able
to explain the basis for the clusters
