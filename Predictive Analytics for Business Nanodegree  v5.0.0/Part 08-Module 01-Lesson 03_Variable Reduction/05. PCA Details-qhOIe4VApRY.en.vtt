00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.949
So now that we understand,
at least at a high level,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.450
the concepts of variable reduction.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.859
Let's see how it might apply to
the business problem we're working on

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:09.839
in our exercises.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.179
Let's move over to Alteryx
to work through an example.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.800
First of all, let's bring in the data
that we prepped in an earlier exercise.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.728
I saved mine as
Data Prep Excerise Results.csv.

00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:26.910
I'll hook a browse tool to
the input tool and run the process.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.449
Let's examine the data
that we have again.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.890
If you look,
we have 59 variables in our data set.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.679
Probably too many to
want to try to explain

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:38.579
how each one ties to
our future clusters.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.369
We can see though,
that we have 12 variables.

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:45.839
One for each month, for
each of the climate metrics,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.750
precipitation, rain,
snow, and temperature.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.000
Now we don't need to cluster
each individual month for

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.399
each climate metric.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.530
It really only makes sense to cluster
on the effects of the four metrics.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
But because we want to make sure that
we are able to capture the variance for

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.439
all of the months in each metric,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.599
PCA is a perfect tool to get
the number of variables reduced.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:12.179
As we shall see,
PCA will allow us to reduce

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.490
the 48 climate variables to just 10 or
12 variables.

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:19.500
And in reality, since these 10 to
12 variables will really represent

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.390
the 4 climate metrics,
it will become much easier to explain.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.230
As I mentioned earlier,
sometimes a hybrid approach works well.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.680
Some of the other variables, such as
days before and after the winter freeze,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.300
which we created in the earlier lesson,
we'll keep as is.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.049
But that should get us to
a much more manageable and

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.819
explainable set of variables in total.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.729
Let's see how the process works for
one of the metrics.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.909
And then we can basically replicate
the same process for the other three.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.659
Now because a principle components
tool expects numeric data, and

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.219
since we saved our data as a CSV,

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.390
we need to reconfigure it
to the correct data types.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.959
We can do that again with a select tool.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.859
And then as we did previously,

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.319
we can use the Data Sample Select Config
file that we used in an earlier lesson.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.449
Since we added two more variables,
I'll change those manually.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.575
Now we can bring in a principal
components tool, and

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:16.340
then we'll need to configure it.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.710
First, we'll select just the fields
related to only one of the metrics.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.195
In this case,
we'll start with temperature.

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:26.394
Next, we need to configure
the process to scale the data.

00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:28.395
If you recall from the previous lesson,

00:02:28.395 --> 00:02:31.675
scaling is important because of
the effect that variables with

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:36.420
big numbers can have when combined
alongside variables with small numbers.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.209
Now in this case,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.680
the difference in our climate
metrics may not be that significant.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.800
But as a general rule, it is usually
better to scale variables unless you

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.510
have a good reason revolving around
a specific set of data to do otherwise.

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.859
Selecting the box next to scale
each field to have unit variance

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.580
will automatically scale the data for
you.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.870
Most of the other configurations
we'll leave the defaults.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.250
I'm going to add one more number to
the number of principal components to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.169
append.

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.769
We'll talk through this in a minute.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.135
Now, if you'll recall,

00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:10.894
when we were looking at
the data in a previous lesson,

00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:16.105
one of the stores had a missing or
null value for the temp October field.

00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:17.064
To make it easy for

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:21.340
this exercise, I mentioned I was just
going to ignore the missing value.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.450
But to keep the principal
components tool happy and

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.719
avoid an error,
I'll need to filter out that record.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.550
I can do this easily
with just a filter tool.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.100
Now we can run the process and

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.500
start taking a look at
what the results tell us.
