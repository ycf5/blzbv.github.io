00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.879
There are two common methods that
can be used for variable reduction.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.689
These are factor analysis or
more technically correct,

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.030
exploratory factor analysis, and
principal components analysis.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.160
Let's go through
the high-level concepts and

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.589
differences between
each of these methods.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:23.169
Let's start by referring back
to the employee survey example.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.920
You will recall that there
were three questions that can

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.239
be related to the concept of employee
satisfaction with supervisor.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.759
Factor analysis assumes
that there is a latent or

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:39.799
hidden variable called a factor
underlying these three questions.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.129
This factor is what basically causes the
way these three questions get answered.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.219
In other words, how satisfied
you are with your supervisor

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.899
will determine how you
answer those questions.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.049
So if you know the factor, which in
this case is really the rating for

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.489
employee satisfaction with supervisor,
you will be

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.650
actually able to predict what
the answers to the three questions are.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:11.250
Principal components analysis,
which is commonly referred to as PCA,

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:17.469
on the other hand, makes no assumptions
about any underlying causal model.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.629
Instead, PCA essentially summarizes
all the variance within the total

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:27.518
variables into fewer components and
reduces the number of variables.

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:31.349
So what is the primary difference
between the two methods?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.069
PCA analyzes all of the variance
within all of the variables selected,

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.119
while factor analysis only analyzes
the variances that are shared or

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.590
common within the variables.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.600
Another way to put it is that
PCA focuses on accounting for

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:56.169
the total variation, whereas factor
analysis focuses on accounting for

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.780
just the correlations
between the variables.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.200
So factor analysis is trying
to answer the question of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.945
what might be causing the responses, and

00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:10.739
PCA is trying to answer how it
can summarize the variables.
