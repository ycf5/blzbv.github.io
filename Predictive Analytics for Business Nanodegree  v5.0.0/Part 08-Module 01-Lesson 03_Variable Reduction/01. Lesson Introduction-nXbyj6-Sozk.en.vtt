00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.349
In this lesson, we will be going over
the concepts of variable reduction.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:07.660
We'll be showing at a high level two
approaches to reducing the number of

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.130
variables, and how they are different.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.880
And then we will focus on
one of those approaches

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.820
as an example to work through.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.679
So let's get started.
