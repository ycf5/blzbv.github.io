00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.240
Now that I've imported
the CSV file into Tableau,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.720
let's play with how we look at the data.

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:10.565
First, I'll bring in the stores
just by Store ID as a column and

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.133
then I'll bring in PC1 as a row.

00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:16.653
And since it's in store
order basically and

00:00:16.653 --> 00:00:21.039
fairly random I am going to
sort it by the value of PC1.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.303
And then I am going to bring in
the labels of the State, and

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:26.989
let's take a look at the whole screen.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.397
If we look at the values for

00:00:28.397 --> 00:00:32.496
the individual object components you
will notice easily from the sorting.

00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:37.016
That the components with the lowest
negative values tend to be the warmer

00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:41.253
states in the US, for example,
Florida, Texas, and Louisiana.

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:45.493
And the components with the higher
positive values tend to be the cooler

00:00:45.493 --> 00:00:49.640
states, so we have Minnesota,
North Dakota, and New York.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.350
Now if we duplicate this sheet,
and interchange PC1 for PC2, where

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.109
this is sorted in the same order as
when we were looking at the PC1 graph.

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.479
We find that there's no real pattern.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.859
This is what we would expect because if
you remember the second component is at

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.540
complete right angles to the first one.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.090
And we would expect no
correlation between the two.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.790
So even though the PC1 values themselves
don't relate to the actual temperatures.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.800
What the PCA process has done is
aggregate as much variance as it can for

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.310
all 12 months into one component.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.930
That's why the chart of PC1 corresponds
with real temperature patterns.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.480
The second component takes
whatever variance is left over and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.980
does the same thing.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.439
But as you can see it doesn't
correlate at all with temperatures.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.819
This happens until all
the variance is accounted for.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.129
So in this case, we actually end
up with 12 components calculated.
