00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.449
As I mentioned in an earlier lesson,
one of the benefits of

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.650
using statistical clustering is that it
can utilize a large number of variables.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.384
However, if a large set of variables
is used in a clustering process,

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:17.204
it can become difficult to understand
the basis of the segmentation.

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.774
This also makes it difficult to make
decisions based off the results.

00:00:21.774 --> 00:00:24.604
So even though you can use
a larger number of variables to

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:25.894
create your clusters,

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:30.754
sometimes it makes sense to try to
aggregate some of those variables.

00:00:30.754 --> 00:00:33.674
This way, it can be easier
to understand the basis for

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:36.129
forming the clusters, and easier for

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.750
you as the analyst to communicate
the story behind the analysis.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.149
For example, say a product buyer for
a retail chain

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.579
is trying to understand which product is
best allocated to a given store group.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.219
It's possible that this group
could be based on something

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.799
like 27 different demographics,
which can make this a challenge.

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:59.909
But on the other hand,

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.390
if they know that a store is in a high
income college educated urban area,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.710
they can now make more intelligent
buying and product allocation decisions.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.409
It's much more helpful if
the variables are around a theme or

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.619
concept rather than individual metrics.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.010
That's why services like Experian come
up with cutesy types of names to help

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.370
identify their consumer segmentation
product, like Status Seeking Singles,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.930
Hispanic Harmony and
Golden Year Guardians.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.260
So in statistics,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.690
there are methodologies that
will do what we just described.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.219
These are called variable
reduction procedures.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.400
Essentially what they do is reduce
the number of observed variables

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.780
into a smaller number of what we
might call artificial variables or

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.299
principal components
that will account for

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.750
most of the variance in all
of the observed variables.
