00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.790
Now because our data actually
relates to geographic positions,

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.939
we can also look at the data as
it appears on a map in the US.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.300
Let's add a new sheet, and
add in the Latitude and Longitude.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.260
And remember, we need to
uncheck the Aggregate Measures.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.880
And we see that sample
that we brought in.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:22.629
Now we can drag the PC1
values to the color mark.

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:26.070
And we'll also drag PC1 into the label.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.839
What's interesting, is that when we
look at the map of the US for the same

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.780
records that we saw in the first chart,
we see the same pattern as expected.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.429
But the map makes a little
better sense of it.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.890
The lower states have the red points,
and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.280
correspond to the negative PC values,
and higher temperatures.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.880
And as we move up the country to
colder average weather for the year,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.320
the number goes positive, and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.710
the colors shift to dark green,
indicating a lower temperature.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.259
Again, PC1 captures almost
92% of the variants, and

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:01.039
we would expect it to
make the most sense.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.700
Now let's duplicate this sheet, and

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.460
substitute PC1 with PC2,
for both color and label.

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.500
If we now look at the map
visualization for

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.340
PC2, we can still see some groupings,
with the central section of the US

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.540
behaving differently than
the coastal sections.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.980
As we'd expect, these groupings
seem uncorrelated to the first map.
