00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.940
So in this lesson, you've learned that
even though clustering can handle

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.719
a larger number of variables,

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:10.910
sometimes it makes sense to reduce the
number of variables as much as you can.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.900
You also got a high level overview of
two methods for variable reduction, and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.899
you've actually worked the process to
get the approximately 50 variables

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:22.509
down to around 15.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640
Now that we have the data that we need,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.149
we can move on to actually
creating the clusters.

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:30.299
So let's get started with that.
