00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.610
So how do you decide go whether
to use factor analysis or PCA?

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.060
Factor analysis is best used when you're
trying to understand the underlying

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.220
factor or
factors from a common set of variables.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.120
With factor analysis, because you're
estimating the underlying cause behind

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.400
the variables,
it becomes easier to conceptualize.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.239
When you have a goal to try to explain
the correlations between the variables,

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.609
factor analysis works best.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.469
For example, it works well
with social science analyses,

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.699
such as attitudinal studies or

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.060
surveys where you're trying to determine
the underlying basis for the responses.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.790
So that's when you would choose factor
analysis, but when would you use PCA?

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.310
If the goal is to explain as much of
the total variance as possible, or

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.120
you want the total picture of the data,
PCA is the choice.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.549
But as mentioned earlier,
because the component you end up with

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.018
are more of abstractions of all
of the data, those components

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.500
may not be easy to interpret or map
out to an easy to understand concept.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.099
With PCA, the balance becomes having a
reduced set of variables that are easier

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:22.250
to work with and yet, being able to use
them to tell the story to the business.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.390
That isn't necessarily easy, but

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.320
we will show how it could
work in our example exercise.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.569
Of course, as we shall see
in the following exercise,

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.289
it doesn't have to be an all-or-none
approach to variable reduction.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.810
It may work well to have a hybrid where
some of the variables are consolidated

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.150
into components and
the others are left alone.
