00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.294
Now let's say we want to combine first and last names into a single full name column.

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:09.449
You can combine strings from several columns using CONCAT.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.919
Simply order the values you want to concatenate and separate them with commas.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.839
If you want a hard code values,

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.740
enclose them in single quotes the way that I'm doing with this space.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:30.289
Alternatively, you can use two pipe characters to perform the same concatenation.
