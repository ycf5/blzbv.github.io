00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.300
Occasionally, you'll end up with a data set that has

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.804
some nulls that you'd prefer to contain actual values.

00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:08.564
Looking at the accounts table,

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:14.557
you might want to clearly label a no primary point of contact as no POC,

00:00:14.557 --> 00:00:17.464
so the results will be easily understandable.

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:23.920
In cases like this, you can use coalesce to replace the null values.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.769
This is something you may want to do frequently when using

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.490
numerical data where you might want to display nulls as zero.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.450
Also, when performing outer joins that result in some unmatched rows,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.190
you may want those unmatched rows to display something other than a null value.

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.759
Of course, this is most valuable when working with a function that treats

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:50.789
nulls differently from zero such as a count or an average.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.129
We can demonstrate this by wrapping the coalesce in

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:02.100
a count function and counting the primary POC column without the coalesce, as well.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.155
As you can see, the count that includes the coalesce,

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:12.489
includes nine more results than the other regular
