00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
It's often the case, the data isn't structured exactly as you'd like.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.135
In a couple of lessons,

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:07.910
you worked with the web events table,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.490
which contains a refer URL that's well pretty messy.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.240
In this lesson, you'll learn a number of

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.344
techniques for cleaning and reorganizing messy data,

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:19.750
so that you can group it the way you want.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.420
You'll also learn how to change

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.890
your columns data type and some tricks for how to manipulate nulls.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.120
Put all that together,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.429
and you'll have a robust toolset for getting from

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.420
raw data to something that's very useful for analysis.
