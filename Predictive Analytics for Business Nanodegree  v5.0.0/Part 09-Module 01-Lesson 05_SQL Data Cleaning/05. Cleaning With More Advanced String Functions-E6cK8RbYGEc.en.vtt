00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
Left and right work pretty well in specific circumstances.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:08.155
When the data is structured very cleanly with a certain number of characters.

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:10.834
If you want a separate city and state,

00:00:10.835 --> 00:00:12.870
you've got to do a little more work.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.004
The first thing that will be helpful is figuring out

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.690
exactly where the city and state split.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.609
Since it will be different for each row,

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.199
we have to use a function that will find

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.169
the comma and identify how far into the record it is.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.303
Position allows you to specify a sub-string,

00:00:27.303 --> 00:00:30.800
then it returns a numerical value equal to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.670
how far away from the left that particular character appears.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.000
You can also use the string position function which is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.695
annotated as as STRPOS to achieve the same results.

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:53.520
Just replace in with a comma and switch the order of the string and the sub-string.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.870
Importantly, both the position and string position functions are case sensitive.

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.464
If you want to look for a character regardless of its case,

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:06.905
you can make the entire string upper or lower case.

00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:12.844
You can use lower to force every character in a string to become lowercase.

00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:18.843
Similarly, you can use UPPER to make all the letters appear as uppercase.

00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:25.844
Let's complete the loop and pull just the city out into its own field.

00:01:25.844 --> 00:01:32.459
We can do this by nesting the position inside a Left function.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:40.500
As you can see, what we really want isn't the full text up to the position of the comma,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.090
we want to end one position before

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.650
the comma so that it's not included in our city column.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.000
We can do this by subtracting one within the left function.
