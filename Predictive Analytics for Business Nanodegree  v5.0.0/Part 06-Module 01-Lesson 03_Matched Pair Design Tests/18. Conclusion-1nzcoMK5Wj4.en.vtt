00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.858
Let's quickly review
what you just learned.

00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:05.443
You now know what matched
pair experiment is and

00:00:05.443 --> 00:00:08.231
how it compares to randomized
design experiment.

00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:12.554
You know how to select treatment units
and matching them to control units.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:16.332
You know how to analyze test results
from a matched pair experiment.

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:19.138
And you can use those results
to make a recommendation.

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:19.890
Great work.
