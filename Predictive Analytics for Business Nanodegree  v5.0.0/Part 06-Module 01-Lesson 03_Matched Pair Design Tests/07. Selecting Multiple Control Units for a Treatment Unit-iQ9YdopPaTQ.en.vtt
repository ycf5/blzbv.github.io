00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.020
When it's possible to do so,
an experiment can be

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.870
designed with more than one control
unit for each treatment unit.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.060
Having more than one control unit for
each treatment unit

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.710
increases the confidence in the baseline
and makes for a better comparison.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.320
In general, there's no hard rule of how
many control units there should be for

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.119
each treatment unit.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.160
As an analyst, you'd want to look
at the statistical distances

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.730
with different number of
control unit matches.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.520
And look to see when the distance
increases significantly.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.380
For example, with Treatment store 111,
the distance jumps

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.710
from 0.001817 to
0.002988 after 2 stores.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.615
And then again from 0.003865
to 0.006045 after 5 stores.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:52.620
And then again to
0.009964 after 6 stores.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.400
When using multiple control units,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.710
the distance is averaged
across the nearest units.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.490
Therefore, it's important
to balance the need for

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.160
more control units with
the best average distance.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.920
Using two control stores would result in

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.410
only a slight decrease
in the average distance.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.950
But would likely increase
the reliability of our analysis.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.234
Using 5 stores would increase
the average distance due to the jump in

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:20.910
distance from the 4th and 5th stores.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.320
So this would likely not be desirable.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.410
And lastly, using 7 stores results in
a substantial increase in distance.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.630
In summary, the goal is to find
the balance between more matches and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.830
average distance between matches.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.570
With this data, 2 matches would
be a great starting point.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.570
let's work through matching control
units to a set of treatment units.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.950
For the new product
introduction experiment,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.670
let's say that your manager is
assigned a set of 10 treatment stores

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.680
in California where the cherry
flavor of the product will be sold.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.920
We'll walk through matching 2 control
stores to each of the stores for

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.830
the set of treatment stores for
cherry flavor.
