00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:04.936
In the quiz, you used a subjective
approach to determine the best control

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:06.416
unit for Store 111.

00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:08.695
However, we would like
to use a systematic and

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:12.550
mathematical way to make
the decision without any guessing.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.150
There are many different algorithms for

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.940
finding matched pairs, with different
levels of computational complexity.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.660
Generally speaking,
these algorithms take

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.860
all of the numeric control variables and
calculate a single value that determines

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.610
how far the treatment unit
is from each control unit.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.770
This is referred to as a distance score.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.200
Alteryx is a tool that calculates
the distance score for

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.050
control units using a KD tree.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.280
Basically, this algorithm calculates
distance across various dimensions and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.650
then matches one to ten control
units to each treatment unit.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.030
We'll demonstrate the use of
the AB Controls tool later.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.860
But for now,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.740
let's take a look at the results
we'd see if we did this in Alteryx.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.080
Store 5035 has a closer statistical
distance than does store 3498.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.500
In fact, mathematically,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.150
store 3498 does not make the top ten
stores because there are other stores

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.290
with five products that
are relatively close in sales.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.230
Therefore, the algorithm weighted the
product count higher than the sales and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.170
use of the algorithm would've changed
the outcome of the previous quiz.
