00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.290
In a new workflow,
let's add two input data tools,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.840
to bring in the store data, and
the list of the treatment stores.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.750
The data for all the stores is in
the file new product control data, and

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.190
the data for

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.485
the treatment stores is in the file,
cherry product treatment stores.

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:18.855
Since we're only looking
at stores in California,

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.915
we'll use a filter tool to limit the
control stores to those in California.

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:26.855
So let's add a filter tool and create a
basic filter where the state equals Ca.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.440
Since we loaded the data from CSV files,
all the fields are loaded as strings.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.240
We need to convert the category sales in
the product comp fields to numeric data

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.555
types for matching purposes, as
the matching algorithm is mathematical.

00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:45.340
Add a select tool to
each data string and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.270
convert the category sales field to
a type of double and the product count

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.890
field to a type of integer 16,
since the field only contains integers.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:59.305
Next, let's add an ab controls
tool onto the canvas.

00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:02.005
This tool has two inputs, D and T.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.625
Connect the data stream with
the treatment stores to the T input and

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:10.025
connect the data with the control
stores to the D or data input.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:13.845
Both data files use the Store ID
as the store identifier, so

00:01:13.845 --> 00:01:16.675
we can configure both identifier
field inputs with Store ID.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.050
As we want to use category sales and
product count as the variables to match

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.850
control stores to treatment stores,
we'll select both values.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.810
Finally, in the instructions we
were asked to find two control

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.360
units per treatment unit.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.830
So, let's change the value to two.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.700
Add a browse tool to each output and
let's run the workflow.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.420
Looking at the c output,
we see the treatment's column

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.380
which identifies the treatment store ID,
the control column shows

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.770
the store IDs of the control stores that
are matched to each treatment store.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.890
You are easily able to create
matched pairs of control stores to

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.260
treatment stores.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.060
Now you give it a try.
