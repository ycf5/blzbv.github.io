00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.640
In the first lesson we discussed the
fact that there are two primary types of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.110
experiments, randomized and
matched pair.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.110
We covered randomized
experiments in detail, and

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.800
now we're going to dive into
matched pair design experiments.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.180
Remember matched pair design experiments
are usually used when the volume of

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.290
observations or individuals is
fairly low, the concern for

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.320
bias is great, and the cost per
observation is high by comparison.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.770
Matched pairing sets up treatment and
control groups for an experiment by

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.800
matching on a unit by unit basis
using a set of control variables.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.930
The goal is to create two groups of
units that are as similar as possible to

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.390
each other, so that we can confidently
say that any changes during the test

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.840
are due to the introduction
of the experimental variable.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.010
A mathematical algorithm is used to
create the treatment control groups

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.240
where for each treatment unit, one or
more control units is selected.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.230
Before we dive into this process,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.940
let's first discuss how to
select treatment units.
