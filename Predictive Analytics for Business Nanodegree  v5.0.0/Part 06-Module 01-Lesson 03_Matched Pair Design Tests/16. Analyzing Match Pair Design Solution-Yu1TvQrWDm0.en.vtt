00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.910
First, import the sales
data into Alteryx.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.860
Next, filter the data to
show only data from 2010,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.110
including the week ending
on January 1st, 2011.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.243
We'll add the formula tool and multiply
the weekly customer spend per store,

00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:22.890
by 1.064 to calculate the 6.4% lift and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.910
a new value for
average weekly customer spend.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.650
Now we're ready to bring in the number
of weekly customers per store per week.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.530
Let's import the data from the weekly
customers per store Excel file,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.740
selecting sheet one for our data.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.430
We'll use a join tool to combine
the data, joining on store ID and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.509
their week ending value.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.893
Also, we'll deselect the right values
of both columns to avoid duplicates.

00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:49.935
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:52.968
Next, let's calculate the total
spent per week, before and

00:00:52.968 --> 00:00:56.750
after the new candy introduction,
using the formula tool.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.900
The formula for
total spent per store, per week,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.810
is simply the average spent per
customer times the number of customers.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.930
We'll repeat and calculate
the predicted new spend per customer.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.510
And finally,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.670
we'll calculate the difference
between the two total spend values.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.575
Running the workflow,
we can see the new values.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:20.088
[SOUND] The total spend column is
the average spend per customer times

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:21.841
the number of customers.

00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:24.480
The new total spend column
is the predicted average

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.210
spend per customer times
the number of customers.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.660
And the difference is simply
the difference between the two columns.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.600
Our last step is to aggregate
the values for the entire year.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.390
We use a summarize tool and select
the sum for the total customer spend and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.800
new total customer spend and
the difference.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.460
Running a workflow provides our answer.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.680
The total sales amount in
2010 was $1.3 million.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.640
Had we introduced the new candy line,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.109
the total spend may have
increased to $1.38 million,

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.644
or, an increase of $83,462.
