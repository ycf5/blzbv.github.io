00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.000
In practice, it is very common that
treatment units are chosen for

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.410
the analyst.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.820
Many companies have a set of test units
that they use over and over again.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.467
For instance, there are set of target
stores in the US that are designated as

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:16.288
test stores for the company.

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:19.824
If you have to choose the treatment
units, you should first,

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.667
identify potential outliers.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:25.320
Second, decide on the number
of treatment units.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.730
And third,
randomly select the treatment units.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.460
To identify potential outliers for
the new product experiment,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.340
we would want to remove stores that
have outlier values for sales and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.719
any stores that are in
states with very few stores.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.475
For a refresher on outliers,

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.420
checkout the course linked
in the instructor notes.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.590
When selecting the number
of treatment units,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.890
the general answer is as many
as possible within reason.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.210
In general, less than ten
treatment units is very low.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.400
Similar to randomized experiments, the
smaller the number of treatment units,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.530
the less confidence we'll have that
the experiment results are valid.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.710
Sometimes, when small numbers
of treatment units are used,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.830
the experiment may need
to be repeated or run for

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.150
a longer period of time to increase
confidence in the results.
