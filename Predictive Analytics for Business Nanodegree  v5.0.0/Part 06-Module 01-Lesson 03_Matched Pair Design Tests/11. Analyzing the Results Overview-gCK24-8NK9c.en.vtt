00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.550
Now, everything is set for
the execution of the experiment.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.970
The new candy product is shipped
to the treatment stores, and

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.590
the experiment is run for one month.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.420
At the end of the month,
the results are in,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.910
and it's now time to
dig into the results.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.390
If you remember lesson two,
when analyzing a completely randomized

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.129
design, we used a T-test to test
the difference between the two groups.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.520
We're going to do something similar for
a matched pair design, but

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.930
since we're comparing each treatment
to one or more control units,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.700
on a unit by unit basis,
we'll use a slightly different T-test.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.260
In the randomized experiment,
the T-test compared the mean and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.310
variance of the treatment observations,
to the mean and

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.000
variance of the control observations.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.527
In matched pair design,
the T-test looks at the mean and

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:51.420
variance of the difference
between each matched pair,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.880
to see if it's significantly
different than zero.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.680
This methodology is used inside of
the A/B analysis tool in Alteryx.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.970
We'll walk through an example next, and
discuss how to interpret the results.
