00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.540
Even more important than the selection
of the treatment stores,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.230
is the selection of the control stores.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.240
These stores will become the baseline
for the analysis of the experiment.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.560
As mentioned before, the process for
selecting treatment and

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.530
control stores is known
as matched pairing.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.590
Matched pairing is where each treatment
store is matched to a control store

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.830
that has very similar measures for
each of the control variables.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.580
In our new product experiment,
we chose three control variables,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.060
sales volume, number of products sold
and state where the store is located.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.350
In the matched pairing process,
for each treatment store,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.740
we would want to select a control store
that has close to the same sales volume,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.190
close to the same number of products
sold, and is in the same state.
