00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's look at the results
of our AB analysis

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.780
by looking at the interactive report
output of the AB analysis tool.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.240
The first box shows the LID percentage,
or

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.130
the difference between the treatment and
the control group.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.920
This can be interpreted as
the average customer spend, per week,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.890
in the treatment store, increased
by 6.4%, during the experiment.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.230
The next box over shows
the expected impact,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.010
per unit, per period,
if the treatment were applied.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.090
This means that the introduction of
the new product would cause customers to

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.890
spend 20 cents more per week,
on average.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.970
And the last box shows
the Significance Level of the T Test.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.690
This is the 1- p level, and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.180
can be interpreted that the test
was highly significant.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.360
Or, that it is highly unlikely the
product launch did not increase sales.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.440
There are also a few plots that
can help you both visualize and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.702
communicate the results.

00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:57.550
The time comparison plots
compares the sales trends,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.725
both before and
after the implementation of the Test.

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:04.834
You can see here that the treatment and
control stores had roughly similar sales

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:07.971
during the historical comparison period,
on the left, but,

00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:11.265
once the experiment started,
there was a considerable increase, or

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:14.120
lift, in the sales for
the treatment stores.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.210
If we scroll down, you can see a dot
plot that shows the actual differences

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.198
between the individual pairs of stores.

00:01:20.198 --> 00:01:23.930
Along the x-axis,
you can see each of the store IDs for

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.470
the treatment stores,
and along the y-axis,

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.840
you have the change in sales from
the comparison to the treatment period.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.690
Each treatment store is plotted against
all the control stores matched to it.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.030
For our example, you can see that while
not all treatment stores outperform

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.430
their respective control stores,
such as stores S027 and S029,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.450
the general trend is that treatment
stores outperform control stores.
