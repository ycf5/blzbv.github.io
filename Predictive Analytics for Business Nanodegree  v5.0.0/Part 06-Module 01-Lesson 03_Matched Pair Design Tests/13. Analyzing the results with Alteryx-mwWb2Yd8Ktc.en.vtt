00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.240
For our example,

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.980
we're going to use data in the
MatchedPairAnalysisExample Excel file.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.250
This file contains the results of
our new candy product introduction

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.610
experiment.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.470
The stores that were used for treatment
stores are in the Treatments tab.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.059
The matched pairs of control and

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.720
treatment stores can be
found in the Pairs tab.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.610
The data from the experiment
can be found in the Data tab.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.350
Baltrex will not only perform the t-Test
and identify the significance of

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.450
the results but will also compare the
treatment and control stores to baseline

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.983
or past data to see the impact
during the treatment period.

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:37.740
In order to do this, you'll need to
feed the tool both the baseline data and

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.490
the data from the experiment.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.120
The experiment was run from October
15th, 2011, and ended on March 17, 2012.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.570
Each week, each store recorded
the average spend per customer.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.180
So let's create a new Alteryx workflow,
and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.696
use the input data tool
to bring in the data.

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:59.601
The control store information is located
in the Pairs tab of the spreadsheet.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.220
So let's import that first.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.025
Next, let's bring in the treatment
store data from the Treatments tab and

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:07.760
lastly, let's bring in
the historical performance

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.950
as well as the data from the experiment
located in the Data tab.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.270
Now that we have the data,
we're ready to up the analysis.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.520
Let's grab an AB analysis tool and
drag it onto the canvas.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.220
Connect the data from the Pairs
tab to the C or Controls input.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.465
Connect the data from the Treatments
tab to the T or Treatment input.

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:32.615
And the data from the Data tab should
go to the P, or Performance input.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.825
Next, let's configure the tool.

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:38.105
On the Input Data tab,
let's set up our analysis as follows.

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:40.690
The control section of
the configuration window

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.710
relates to the control store data in
the Pairs tab, coming in on the C input.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.670
The controls field is
the control unit identifier.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.840
And the treatments field is
the treatment unit mapping field.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.790
The treatment section uses the data
coming in from the T input.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.710
And we're looking for the field
to match the treatment identifier

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.510
with the treatment identifier
from the controls field.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.340
So we should use store ID
from the treatment stream

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.550
to match to the treatments
field of the control stream.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.070
For the performance data, we'll use the
right store ID, the Week Ending date and

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.300
the Spend Customer fields to
finish our configuration.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.570
Clicking on the Test Dates tab, we need
to enter the dates of our experiment.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.160
The start date was October 15th, 2011.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.610
And the end date was March 17th, 2012.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.750
Next, let's add browse
tools by right-clicking

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.270
on the AB Analysis tool and
selecting Add All Browses.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.913
Let's run the work flow and
take a look at the results.

00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:37.259
