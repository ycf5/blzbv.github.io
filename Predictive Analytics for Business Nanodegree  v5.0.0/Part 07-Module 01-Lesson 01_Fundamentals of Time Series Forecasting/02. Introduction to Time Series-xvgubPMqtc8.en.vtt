00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.940
Let's examine some of the building
blocks of a time series.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.130
Ever since mankind first noticed
the regular movement of the sun and

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.320
the stars, we have wondered
about the passage of time.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.660
Our ancestors first recorded the phases
of the moon some 30,000 years ago, and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.230
recording time has been a way by which
humanity has represented the progress of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.760
civilization.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.800
It's how we plan, schedule, or arrange
when something should happen or be done.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.230
It's the events in our past,
present, and future.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.020
For us, in this course, we'll discuss
time a little less philosophically, and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.650
concentrate on the data that is
collected on recorded time periods.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.590
The first defining characteristic
of a time series is a list

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.520
of observations where
the ordering matters.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.790
Ordering is very important because
there is a dependency on time and

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.890
changing the order could change
the meaning of the data.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.645
Now, to accurately
forecast future values,

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:54.050
we'll need each measurement of data
to be taken across sequential and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.510
equal intervals, and with each time
unit having at most one data point.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.160
Once we have collected our data,
as a business analyst,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.050
we have two objectives in mind.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.260
First, identifying the patterns
represented by the sequence of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.430
observations, and second, forecasting or

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.750
predicting future values
of the time series.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.290
The patterns we observe will tell us the
story of how our business interacts with

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.590
time.
