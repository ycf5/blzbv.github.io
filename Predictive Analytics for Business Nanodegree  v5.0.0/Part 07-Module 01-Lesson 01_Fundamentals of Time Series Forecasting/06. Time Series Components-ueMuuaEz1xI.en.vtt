00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.930
Before we can crunch any numbers and
make a predictive model, we need to

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.200
plot our data in order to get a feel for
what our time series looks like.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.700
A time series plot shows a graphical
presentation of the relationship

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.750
between time and
the time series target variable.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.533
Time is on the horizontal axis and

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.916
the target variable's values
are shown on the vertical axis.

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:22.966
The first plot shows the complete
Bates Hotel time series.

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.438
We can see that the series shows
a general trend up and to the right.

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:28.922
We call that an upward trend.

00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:31.976
Lastly, our bookings plot
shows two main patterns.

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:34.425
First, we see the upward trend.

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:37.618
Secondly, we see some regularly
occurring fluctuations up and

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:40.000
down within the same calendar year.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.200
We called that a seasonal pattern.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.933
Plotting out the time series allows
us to visualize these patterns and

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:45.760
behaviors.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.836
We can then used our findings in
the time series plot to create and

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:51.262
fine-tune sophisticated
forecasting models.
