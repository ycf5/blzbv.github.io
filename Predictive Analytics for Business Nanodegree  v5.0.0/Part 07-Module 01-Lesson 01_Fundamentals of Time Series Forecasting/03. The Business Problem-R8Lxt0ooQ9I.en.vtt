00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.510
To better understand and apply these
methods, we'll examine a business

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.210
problem surrounding how management at
Bates Hotel, a mountain resort walking

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.120
distance from the best slopes in town,
are able to prepare for

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.150
their year by forecasting the number of
room bookings they expect each month.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.870
This information can help management
make informed decisions on staffing,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.548
hospitality arrangements,
and pricing for rooms.

00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:24.470
They have tasked their business
analysts, you, to forecast bookings so

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.490
they can make the necessary
preparations.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.210
Historical bookings data contains
monthly data from the past ten years,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.326
and the forecast should contain monthly
bookings for the next six months.

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:38.387
Your job will to be use to the
historical bookings data from years past

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:40.846
to one, investigate and clean the data.

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:44.649
Two, determine trend and
seasonal components, three,

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.063
apply findings to an ARIMA and
ETS model in Alteryx,

00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:51.490
lastly, forecast bookings for
the next 6 months.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.510
That's quite a lot to think about.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.380
But don't worry, we'll be taking
a closer look at time series

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.040
forecasting methods and
what they all mean.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.520
First let's take a quick quiz to
review what makes a set of data

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.660
a time series data set.
