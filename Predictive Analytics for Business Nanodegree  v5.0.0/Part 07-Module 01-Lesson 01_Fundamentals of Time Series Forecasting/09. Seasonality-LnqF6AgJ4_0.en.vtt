00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.700
A time series that exhibits a repeating
pattern at fixed intervals of time

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.410
within a one year period is said to
have a seasonal pattern or seasonality.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.510
Seasonality is a common pattern seen
across many different kinds of time

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.500
series.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.880
For example, if you live in a climate
with cold Winters and warm Summers

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.550
your home's air conditioning costs
probably rise in the summer and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.010
fall in the winter.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.550
You would reasonably expect
the seasonality of your air conditioning

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.150
costs to recur every year.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.690
Likewise, a company that sells heavy
coats would see sales jump in the Winter

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.420
but drop in the Summer.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.540
Companies that understand the seasonal
patterns of their business can time

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.440
inventories, staffing, and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.219
other decisions that coincide with
the expected change in business.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.568
The US postal service hiring temporary
drivers and workers during the holiday

00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:49.340
season shows how a company adapts to
meet a change caused by seasonal demand.
