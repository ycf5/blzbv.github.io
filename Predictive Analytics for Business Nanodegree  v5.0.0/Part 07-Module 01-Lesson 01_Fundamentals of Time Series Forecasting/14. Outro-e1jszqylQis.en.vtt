00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.910
Let's take a step back and look at what
we can now identify in a time series.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.770
You're now able to recognize the four
distinct characteristics of a time

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.480
series.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.630
And whether your business problem should
use an advanced time series forecasting

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.590
method.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.050
We've also identified key concepts
such as trend, seasonal, and

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:16.889
cyclical pattens.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.720
Now, we're ready to
move onto the fun part.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.490
In the next section, we're going to be
learning more about our first predictive

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370
model type, exponential smoothing.
