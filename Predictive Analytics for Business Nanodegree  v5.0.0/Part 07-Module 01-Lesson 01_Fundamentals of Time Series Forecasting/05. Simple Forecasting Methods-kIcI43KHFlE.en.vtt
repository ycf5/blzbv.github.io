00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.520
Some forecasting methods are very
simple and occasionally effective.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.430
But they do have their faults.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.260
Let's take a look at Sam,
the simple forecaster,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.070
who previously worked in your
position at Bates Hotel and

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.580
how he used simple forecasting
methods to forecast bookings.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.820
When Sam was first tasked with
forecasting bookings for Bates Hotel,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.750
he didn't know how to use
a sophisticated predictive model to add

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.580
early forecast results.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.830
Nor did Sam want to
take the time to learn.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.520
Instead, Sam used simple
forecasting methods so

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.790
he could hit the slopes before
they closed at the end of the day.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.470
Sam's first attempt at forecasting
was to use an average method.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.990
Here, the forecast of all future values

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.550
are equal to the average
of historical data.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.060
The average model assumes that the best
predictor of what will happen tomorrow

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.786
is the average of everything
that has happened up until now.

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:52.404
For Sam and Bates Hotel management,
this was not the case.

00:00:52.404 --> 00:00:54.981
Using our Sam the simple forecaster CSV,

00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:59.160
we can calculate what Sam
forecasted using this method.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.990
As you can see, Sam missed his
mark by over 9,000 bookings.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.110
Yikes.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.060
&gt;&gt; The next month,
Sam used the moving average method.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.290
This method uses the average of
a time series over a defined number

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.610
of time periods.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.220
Sam figured that the last 12 months of
bookings would be a good moving average

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.080
to base his next forecast.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.830
Again, Sam was wrong,
missing by almost 3,000 bookings.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.539
Management is starting to become
frustrated with the results.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.480
Sam decided to give another method a try
since he's been unsuccessful with his

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.550
previous two forecasts.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.060
This time he tried the naive method.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.640
In this method all forecasts are simply
set to be the value of the last

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.990
observation.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.498
Sam is getting closer yet
still off by over 1,000 bookings.

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:46.910
Naive methods are commonly used
when starting a time series.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.012
If there is not enough data
to create a predictive model,

00:01:50.012 --> 00:01:53.518
the naive method can supplement
forecasts for the near future.

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:57.270
It is also a theoretical basis for
sophisticated modeling.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.540
For Bates Hotel though, they have lost
potential revenue using this method.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.150
Sam was given one more chance to
forecast bookings for the next month.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.903
Without any luck on
his previous methods,

00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:09.190
he wants again to change his approach.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.755
This time using a seasonal naive
method..Unbeknownst to Sam,

00:02:12.755 --> 00:02:17.070
management outsourced the bookings
forecast to a consulting firm.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.190
They believed using a sophisticated
exponential smoothing model

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.349
that they can beat Sam's forecast for
this next month.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.060
Poor Sam.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.680
Unfortunately for Sam, they were right.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.470
Using the seasonal naive method,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.570
Sam was once again off by
more than 1,000 bookings

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.820
with the consultants narrowly missing
their forecast by only a few hundred.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.510
Had Sam known that the Seasonal
Naive Method will assume that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.180
the magnitude of the seasonal
pattern will remain constant,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.120
he would have made a better
choice selecting his method.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.380
Needless to say, Sam was let go.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.340
Don't be like Sam.
