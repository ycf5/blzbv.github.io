00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.401
In time series analysis,
a trend is a gradual shift or

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:07.360
movement to relatively higher or
lower values over a long period of time.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.214
When our trend pattern exhibits
a general direction that is upward,

00:00:11.214 --> 00:00:15.210
where there are higher highs and
higher lows, we call this an uptrend.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.481
When our trend pattern exhibits
a general direction that is down,

00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:23.994
where there are lower highs and
lower lows, we call this a downtrend.

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:27.801
A time series can experience changing
direction where it can go from

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.346
an Uptrend to a Downtrend.

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:33.700
If there were no trend, we call it
a Horizontal or stationary trend.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.780
Each trend we see in a time
series is call the trend cycle.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.670
When looking at the plot of
the Bookings data from Bates Hotel,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.260
we see that Bates Hotel continues to
increase their bookings year over year,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.880
creating an uptrend in the time series.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.440
If Bates Hotel reaches capacity,
then bookings will trend sideways.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.000
And should a competing hotel
open up down the street and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.895
steal their bookings,
Bates would experience a downtrend.
