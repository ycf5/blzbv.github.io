00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.190
Hi, welcome to
the Time Series Forecasting course.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.785
Before we dive into any lessons,

00:00:05.785 --> 00:00:09.640
let's examine what exactly
time series forecasting is.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.030
Well, to put it simply, time series
forecasting is the use of a statistical

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.530
model to predict future values,
based on past results.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.980
So what kinds of variables
can we forecast?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.790
Any value that can be tracked and
collected over time.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.670
Think of annual population data,
a company's daily stock price or

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.330
quarterly sales figures.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.260
For each of these examples,
data is collected over time and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.130
the time series model is simply using
that data to forecast future values.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.020
During the course, we'll answer
questions like how do I define time?

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.545
Or what are trends?

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:43.760
[LAUGH] Not that kind of trend.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.120
And what are seasonal patterns?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.340
We'll also dig into how to use
particular forecasting models

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.220
like an Exponential Smoothing or ETS,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.400
and an Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average or ARIMA models.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.060
Along the way we will be working
through a specific business problem

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.620
in Alteryx designer to examine
these topics in more detail.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.430
Now wait.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.920
Do you need to be an expert in
all Alteryx prior to this course?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.889
Not at all.

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:10.511
Luckily, you've been working with our
pros here at Alteryx in previous courses

00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:13.818
and I'll help continue painting your
analytical picture on the designer

00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:14.261
canvas.

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:18.718
But first, let's briefly look at
where time series forecasting fits

00:01:18.718 --> 00:01:21.146
relative to other types of analysis.

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:24.938
In the Problem Solving with Advanced
Analytics course, you're introduced to

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:28.391
Methodology Map which is used to
determine which methodology is best for

00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:29.950
a particular analysis.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.660
So, with our business problem, we need
to identify if we're doing data analysis

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.330
or trying to predict an outcome.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.380
This one's easy,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910
we're trying to predict future
values based on past observations.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.691
Next, we'll continue along
in the Data Rich branch and

00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:45.475
into our Numeric family of models.

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:48.550
The time series will need a numeric
variable that we'd like to predict.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.130
This is our target variable.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.430
And it also needs a time based variable.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.614
Think about our examples.

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:57.500
Year over year population,
a stock's daily closing price and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.640
lastly, our quarterly sales figures.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.890
All of this are numeric variables.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.120
The data for these examples
are collected by year, day, and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.780
quarter, respectively.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.410
So each observation has
a time component to it.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.680
If the business problem involves
predicting these values into the future,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.360
then time series forecasting
models like ARIMA and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.160
ETS models will be most appropriate.
