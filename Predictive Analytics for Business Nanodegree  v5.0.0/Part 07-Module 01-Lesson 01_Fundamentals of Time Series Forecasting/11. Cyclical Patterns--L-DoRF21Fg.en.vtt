00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.150
What if we see a pattern in our data,

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.890
that doesn't occur within
the same calendar year?

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.000
Is that still a seasonal pattern?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.889
A cyclical pattern exists,
when data exhibits rises and

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.370
falls that are not of a fixed period.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.370
Think of business cycles which
usually last several years, but

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.110
where the length of the current
cycle is unknown beforehand.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.090
In finance, times of expansion and

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.228
recession in the stock market
reveal cyclical patterns.

00:00:24.228 --> 00:00:27.180
A cyclical uptrend is
referred to a bull market,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.030
while a cyclical downtrend is
referred to as a bear market.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.960
These patterns in the general
market occupy multiple years, and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.950
don't have a repeating
pattern within each year.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.314
Many people confuse cyclical
behavior with seasonal behavior, but

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:42.610
they are quite different.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.960
If the fluctuations are not of a fixed
period, then they are cyclical.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.400
If the period is unchanging and

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.800
associated with some aspect of the
calendar, then the pattern is seasonal.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.570
In general, with cyclical patterns,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.450
the average length of cycles is longer
than the length of the seasonal pattern.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.640
And the magnitude of cycles tends to
change more than the magnitude of

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.190
seasonal patterns.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.920
Also, cyclical patterns are much
harder to predict as well.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.400
The decline in stock
markets is often sudden and

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.850
violent, all coming as
a surprise to most.
