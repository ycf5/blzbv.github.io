00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.020
What we see now is a seasonality plot.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.020
Again, all time series plots, the
vertical axis is our target variable,

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.980
the horizontal axis
shows our seasonality.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.560
For example, with monthly data,
all the monthly values are plotted in

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.130
chronological order with each
month on the horizontal axis.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.575
The numbers one through ten represent
the ten years of data that we have seen

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:22.460
in the time series.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.840
When looking at this plot with the Bates
Hotel time series, we can tell our

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.700
results during winter and
summer months are significantly higher.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.300
These findings are not surprising,
considering most people go to the hotel

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.830
during these months to take
advantage of the skiing and hiking.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.150
Since this pattern repeats each
year at the same time intervals,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.249
we can safely say that our time
series contains seasonality.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.450
Another noticeable characteristic of the
Bates Hotel booking seasonality plot,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.920
is that the magnitude of bookings
increases year after year.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.020
Keep this in mind,
as it will be important for

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.810
our later lessons in
predictive modeling.
