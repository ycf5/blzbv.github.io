00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.110
Now that we have some of the basics and
a vocabulary of experimental design

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.790
down, let's talk about two
different types of experiments and

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.060
when you'd use each of them.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.960
The two types of experiments that
we'll be discussing in this course

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.360
are Randomized Design and
Matched Pair Design.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.300
Randomized design is a technique
where the treatment and

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.550
control units are selected
completely randomly.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.790
This technique is used primarily
in situations where there is

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.470
very little opportunity to control
variables, and where the volume and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.365
velocity of data is high enough
that you're not worried about bias.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:35.930
Website-based experiments and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.270
phone system-based experiments are great
examples of when the organization

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.310
has little ability to control who
visits a site or who calls in.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.160
And the volume is usually high
enough that biases can be avoided.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.500
Additionally, the cost per
observation is usually very

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.340
low in these experiments.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.250
In randomized experiments, whether an
individual is in the treatment group or

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.660
control group is not predetermined.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.610
It's determined on the fly in
a completely random fashion.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.750
For example, the traffic is routed
randomly in such a way that people who

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.420
visit a website will see one of
the two pages, the treatment page or

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.300
the control page.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.220
In contrast, a matched pair is usually
used when the volume of observations or

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.100
individuals is fairly low.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700
And the concern for
bias is great, and the cost for

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.660
observation is high by comparison.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.910
In this experimental design technique,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.770
the treatments are matched by
controls on a unit to unit basis.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.450
Using a weighting of
the identified control variables.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.980
In our new product experiment, a matched
pair design would involve taking each

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.270
treatment store and finding one or more
similar control stores to match it to.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.350
Analysis is done on
a pair by pair basis,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.029
then aggregated to a single result.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.400
This unit by unit matching helps
eliminate sources of bias, and

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.600
it increases confidence in results,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.940
even with a lower number
of total observations.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.740
Unlike a completely randomized design, a
matched pair design must be set up ahead

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.280
of time, and all units must be known
before the start of the experiment.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.280
For example, we would match each
of the treatment candy stores with

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.810
one to two control stores in order to
measure the impact of the treatment.
