00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.230
In order to setup a good experiment,

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.740
we need to split our groups
into two comparable groups.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.930
We call these two groups the Treatment
Group and the Control Group.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.670
A Treatment group is the collection of
units that will be getting the treatment

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.730
and will refer to these
units at treatment units.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.170
The treatment is the change
that you're making.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.160
It is the new thing you're testing.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.830
In the new product introduction example,
this is the sale of the new product.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.220
Using the example from the previous
quiz, the treatment group at their

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.390
corporate recruiting company would be
the employees that work from home.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.960
The treatment is working from home.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.710
For each treatment group, you need
a control group that is used a baseline

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.180
comparison for the treatment group.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.370
In the control group,
no treatment is applied.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.640
For our experiment,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.450
this means that our control group
stores will not sell the new product.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.060
These stores are referred
to as control units.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.510
At the recruiting company,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.549
the control group would be
the employees working in the office.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.760
This is the control group because no
treatment or changes that applied.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.870
In later lessons, we'll learn how to
set up treatment and control groups

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.350
based off of the design of the
experiment that makes the most sense for

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.900
the business problem
you're trying to solve.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.650
Just like in modeling, as an analyst,
you'll have a series of variables

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.160
available to you That could or could
not be important to the experiment.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.670
Similarly to building a model,
we'll have a target variable.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.112
Or the variable that we're trying
to predict the outcome for.

00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:34.550
In the new prompt introduction
experiment, the target variable is sales

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.490
because we're concerned with how the new
product introduction will affect sales.
