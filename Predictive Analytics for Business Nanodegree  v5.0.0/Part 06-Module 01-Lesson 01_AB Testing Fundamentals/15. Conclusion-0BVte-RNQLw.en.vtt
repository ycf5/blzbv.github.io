00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.925
In this lesson, we've introduced
the concept of AB testing and

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:06.900
discussed the fundamentals
of designing an experiment.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.350
We stopped short of actually running the
experiment and analyzing the results.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.450
The next two lessons will cover the two
types of experiments, randomized and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.650
matched pair in more detail.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.702
And we'll spend a lot of time going
through the analysis of these types of

00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:24.000
experiments to arrive at a conclusion
for your business problems.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.580
Let's keep going.
