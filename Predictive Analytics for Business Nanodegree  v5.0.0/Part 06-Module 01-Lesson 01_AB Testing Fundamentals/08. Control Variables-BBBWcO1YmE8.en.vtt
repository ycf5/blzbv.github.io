00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.100
As you can imagine the list of possible
variables to control can get very long.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.610
How do you know which variables
are truly important to control.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.630
In this section we'll discuss
techniques to identify

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.680
which variables are the most
important to control.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.892
Remember that the main purpose of
control variables is to make sure

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:21.380
that you have a good match between
treatment and control units.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.690
So that the comparison being made
in the experiment is a good one.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.360
Five steps should be followed to
determine which control variables should

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.850
be used to set up the experiment.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.390
First, come up with a list
of potential variables.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.020
Next, determine whether you
have data for those variables.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.000
Then make sure that the connection
between the target variable and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790
each control variable is logical.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.155
Next, test the correlation between
the control and target variables.

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:53.330
And lastly, test correlation
between other correlation variable

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.689
to avoid similar variables.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.865
Let's walk through the process for
the new product introduction example.

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:03.040
Here's a short list of variables
that could affect sales of the candy

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.290
category.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.090
Remember, we're measuring the sales of
the category because sales of the new

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.110
product could take away from
sales of existing products.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.920
The number of products offered at the
store could be used to compare stores or

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.200
the volume of candies sold.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.800
We may be interested in the number of
customers that visit each store, or

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.560
the number of competitive products.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.100
The size and location of the store could
possibly be used, or the demographics of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.490
the community around the store might
be used as control variables as well.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.400
This may not be a comprehensive list,
but is a pretty good one to start with.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.734
Once you have the list you first need to
identify which ones you have data for.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.640
If you don't have data for
the variables you can't control for it.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.710
The number of customers you stop in
the store is something that is not

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.980
likely available to the manufacturer so
let's cross it off the list.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.250
The company probably knows how many
competitive products there are in

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.120
general.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.720
But not which ones
are sold at each store.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.070
So let's cross that off the list.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.830
Now that we've eliminated
the variables that don't have data,

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.460
we need to look at
the variables logically.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.750
The remaining variables all have
logical connections to store sales.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.780
However, for the purpose of
this analysis, location and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.980
demographics are likely
measuring the same thing.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.570
Location will affect sales
because it will be related to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.050
the demographics of the customer
shopping in the store.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.750
Therefore, we can eliminate
one of the two variables.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.770
Since location may encompass
many demographic variables

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.890
let's choose to keep location and
eliminate demographics.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070
After taking stock of
what we have access to,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.290
the list has been narrowed to
the following possible controls.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.350
The number of products sold and the
total volume of category sold at each

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.040
store and the size and
location of the store.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.500
Next to test correlation
let's use Altrix.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.760
If you're not familiar with Altrix
take a look at a few of the resources

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.810
in the instructor notes.
