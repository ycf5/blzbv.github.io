00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:05.020
Hi, my name is Patrick Nussbaumer, and
I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.640
I work for Alteryx, a leader in
self-service data analytics, and

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.470
I've worked with data acquisition and
analysis for over 20 years.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.560
Imagine that you work
at a large bank and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.684
you're contemplating changing operating
hours at all of your bank branches.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.830
You're not sure if the change will
lead to better performance and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.520
want to run an experiment to determine
if you should proceed or not.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.490
It would be great if you could change
the hours at a few branches and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.830
then base your decision on all branches
on the limited data that you gathered.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.392
This is exactly the type of scenario
that is a perfect fit for AB testing.

00:00:39.392 --> 00:00:43.875
Using AB testing methodologies, you
can design an experiment where you can

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:48.569
determine if the performance of a group
of branches with the modified hours have

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.970
statistically significant results
over the control branches.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.900
And you can use this information
to guide your business decision.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.339
In this course, we'll learn how
to set up and analyze AB tests.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.004
AB testing is a type of experiment
with two variants, A and B,

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:09.750
which are the control and
variation in a controlled experiment.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.140
You can use AB testing to
help solve business problems

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.710
when you don't have enough data
to use modeling techniques.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.224
The two types of experiments that
will be discussed in this course

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:23.780
are randomized design and
matched pair design.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.380
The first lesson in this course will
walk you through the fundamentals of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.040
experimental design, then we'll
cover the two types of AB tests.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.220
Lesson two will focus on
randomized designs and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.590
lesson three will focus
on matched pair designs.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.920
We'll then build upon what we've
learned in lesson four and

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.240
address a slightly more
complicated business problem.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.530
To get started with experimental design,
let's introduce a business problem that

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.670
we'll reference throughout the course to
give some context to the terminology and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.599
processes that you'll learn.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.070
You've recently become the brand
manager for a large candy manufacturer.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.930
The product development team
has been hard at work coming

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.820
up with a new line of products for
your brand.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.759
As this is a new product and the company
is unsure if it will be successful or

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.550
not, you're being asked to
predict the effect on sales

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.190
if the new product is introduced so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.800
management can determine if the product
should go into full distribution.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.100
In this situation, we have no past
information to help us build a model and

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.590
predict what will happen in the future.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.530
Being in this data-poor situation, we
have only one course of action to help

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.210
us with our business problem,
set up an experiment.
