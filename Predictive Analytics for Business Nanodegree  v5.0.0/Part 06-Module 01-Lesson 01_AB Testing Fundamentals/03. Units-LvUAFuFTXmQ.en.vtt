00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.280
Like most things in life,
experimental design

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.960
has a set of vocabulary words
that we need to understand.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.700
In an experiment each individual
in a test is called a unit.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.180
A unit can be a person, a store,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.310
a run on a production line,
a visit to a website etc.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.200
Using our use case,
let's work out what the units are.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.910
In the new product introduction
experiment, you are trying to determine

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.450
the potential sales if the new
product is introduced.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.920
So first, how will you actually
gather the data you need

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.630
to figure out potential candy sales?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.090
One way would be to put candy up for
sale in a few stores and

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.890
observe the results.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.650
In this case each store will be
treated as an individual test, so

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.290
we will refer to each store as a unit.
