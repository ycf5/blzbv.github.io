00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.460
We've selected experimental and
control variables.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.970
And the next step, would be to match
the treatment and control groups.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.470
however, matching is dependent
upon the type of experiment, so

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.960
we'll skip the topic here, and
discuss in detail in the later lessons.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.190
The last thing to do, is to decide
on how long to run the test?

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.690
Like many things in AB analysis,
there is no set rule for

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.490
how long an experiment needs to run.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.200
The answer really has to do
with what you are testing.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.159
An experiment should run for
at least one cycle for

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.150
whatever you're trying to observe.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.089
This is pretty vague, so
let's take a look at some examples.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.480
Amazon wants to know if changing
the layout of their homepage

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.550
will increase the percentage of people
that click on an advertisement.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.850
Shoppers are randomly sent
to one of two page layouts,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.870
the treatment and the control.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.450
How long should this experiment run?

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.250
If Amazon knew that the majority
of their customers shopped on

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.890
their site once a week, then a week
would represent a full cycle.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.380
And the experiment should run for
a week.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.379
What could happen if they didn't run for
a full cycle?

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.015
Amazon get so many visits a day,
that they could theoretically get a very

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:11.830
large amount of data for
an experiment in the few hours.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.880
What we're really trying to
find out is whether or not.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.140
The group of people is representative of
the population of all of their shoppers.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.460
If they ran the experiment in
the middle of the day for two hours,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.790
they may not have a good representation
of people who work during the day,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.570
and might have skewed the results.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.980
Having a full cycle of data reduces the
chance of having bias in the responses.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.900
However, a full cycle is
not always possible for

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.810
the length of an experiment.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.270
The life of a cycle is not always known.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.510
The analysts and business experts
must use their best judges when

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.390
they're on a time frame that is
long enough to not be biased.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.160
But also fits within the time
constraints of the business needs.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.630
The amount of time that the experiment
is going to run is important to nail

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.250
down as early as
possible in the process.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.820
Because that'll addicted how much past
data you need to set up the experiment?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.810
To do the analysis of an experiment, an
equal amount of past data is needed for

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.389
baseline comparison as
the length of the experiment.
