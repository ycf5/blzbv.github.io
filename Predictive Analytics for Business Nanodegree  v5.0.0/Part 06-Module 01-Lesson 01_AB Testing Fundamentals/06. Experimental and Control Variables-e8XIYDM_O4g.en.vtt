00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.019
In an experiment,
we also have an experimental variable,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.210
sometimes called a treatment variable,
or an independent variable.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.990
This is the variable that you change to
see how it affects the target variable.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.300
In the new product introduction
experiment that we're setting up,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.930
the experimental variable is
the sale of the new candy.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.130
The other variables or

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.940
data that we have about the units
are called control variables.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.450
These are now just the predictor
variables in modeling.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.030
They are the variables that
are most influential on

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.369
the outcome of the target variable.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.270
In our experiment there could
be other information about

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.709
the stores that are available
to us as an analyst.

00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:44.700
The other variables or data that we have
about each such as sales, customers,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.540
demographics or location would
be known as control variables.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.490
Control variables are treated a little
differently then predictor variables.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.710
They're not going to be used to build
an equation to make a prediction

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.080
on a future value.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.400
We already know we don't have
enough information to do that.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.550
Instead, control variables are used to
make sure that the treatment units and

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.230
control units are as similar
to each other as possible.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.930
This allows for

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.230
the comparison of the target variable
to be as accurate as possible.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.460
For instance, in our experiment, we
want to know the effect of adding a new

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.580
product to the set of products
that our brand sells at a store.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.780
We look at the effect and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.170
adding the product to the whole set
of products that the brand has.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.060
Because if people buy the new product
instead of the one they would

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.700
have bought anyway,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.980
then the new product could have more
sales because loses in other products.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.070
In order to compare a store that
is going to sell the new product

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.810
to one that is not we need to make
sure they're similar as possible.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.260
For example,
we want stores of similar sales levels,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.020
geographies, customer demographics etc.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.960
This is super important because we want
to measure the impact of the product

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.970
launch independent of other factors.
