00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.990
So how many control
variables should you use?

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.570
Well, there's no hard rule.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.890
It could be as few as one, or
as many as five and sometimes more.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.020
Having too many control
variables is usually worse for

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.550
an experiment than having too few.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.390
We'll go into the reasons why when
we talk about how treatments and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.680
control units are selected
in later lessons.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.850
When choosing control variables,
you should also think about

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.010
the possibility of something
being a lurking variable.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.860
Also called a confounding variable.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.960
A lurking variable is when
a variable is highly correlated with

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.560
both target variable and
another control variable.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.230
This can cause you to overweight
a control variable or

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.679
include the control variable
that really isn't important.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.620
For example, you may look at some data
and decide that the consumption of ice

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.140
cream is related to the number
of deaths due to drowning.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.980
Therefore, you may want to use
the consumption of ice cream

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.970
as a control variable.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.640
In reality,
both the consumption of ice cream and

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.410
the number of deaths due to drowning
are related to temperature.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.660
Temperature is the lurking
variable in this example.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.980
When controlling for the temperature,
you can observe that there's no

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.610
relationship between the consumption
of ice cream and death from drowning.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.280
In general, lurking variables can
be avoided by using sound logic and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.900
taking the time to think through
your controlling variables
