00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.815
Stories have the power of captivating in a way that facts just cannot compete.

00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:06.625
When you're presenting your findings,

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:08.129
make sure to tell a story.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.330
When telling a story about data,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.660
you should start with a compelling question.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.330
If you're providing an entire presentation,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.600
supplement your question with engaging visuals.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.515
Continue to motivate your question with additional examples or

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.780
deeper questions to help your audience further

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.810
engage and understand the context of your question.

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.310
Repetition of the problem is a good thing.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.100
It can be simple and clearly explicit.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.859
Repetition in visuals and audio cues

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.359
helps your audience move your question to long term memory.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.729
Now, provide the data that supports an answer to the question.

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.049
Highlight the answer so that no one can miss it.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.195
Conclude with a call to action for your audience.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:55.570
Data by itself does not move people to take action.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.475
You must motivate the action.

00:00:57.475 --> 00:00:59.635
Data can assist in your conclusion,

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:04.394
but you must provide the context for the next steps for your audience to take.

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:06.229
In the next concept,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.495
you will see two versions of the same presentation with

00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:14.000
the same information and you can decide who tells a better story.
