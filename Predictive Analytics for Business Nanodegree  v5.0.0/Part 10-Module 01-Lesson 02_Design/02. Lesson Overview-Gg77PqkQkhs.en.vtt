Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic is an expert in storytelling with data.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.324
In her book, Storytelling with Data,

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:12.375
she lays out six lessons for communicating with data.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:16.530
First, understand the context of your visualization.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.234
Second, choose the appropriate visual display.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:24.640
We saw the most common visualizations in the last lesson.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.135
Third, eliminate the clutter.

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:31.920
Remove parts of the visual that take away from the points you're trying to make.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.774
Fourth, focus the attention where you want it.

00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:41.920
Highlight the parts of the feature that you want your audience to notice and act upon.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.765
Fifth, think like a designer.

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:46.829
This is the hardest aspect for me,

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.449
but we will see more of those details in this lesson.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.070
And finally, tell a story.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.820
The visuals you display to others should provide a story that moves the viewer to act.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.549
In the previous lesson,

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.359
you learned about the displays that can be used with different data types.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.109
In this lesson, we want to focus on these final components to

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.379
help you best display your data and best convey your message.
