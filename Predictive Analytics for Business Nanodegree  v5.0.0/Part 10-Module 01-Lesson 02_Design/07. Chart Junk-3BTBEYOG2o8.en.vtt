00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.984
When you're choosing how to display your data,

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.594
it's important to not only think about what you put

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:09.029
into a visual but also what you're going to leave out.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.979
This brings us to chart junk.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.690
Chart junk is a term that refers to all visual elements in charts

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.640
and graphs that are not necessary to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.745
comprehend the information represented in that chart.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:25.525
They might also distract the viewer from the information you're trying to provide.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:29.419
Markings and visual elements can be called chart junk if they're not

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.105
a part of the minimum set of visuals necessary to communicate clearly.

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:36.390
Let's go through a few examples.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
Examples of chart junk include those listed here.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:44.549
Heavy or dark grid lines, unnecessary text,

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.369
pictures surrounding or within graphs,

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:49.949
shading or 3D components,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.370
or ornamented chart or axes.

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.429
This example shows how charged junk obscures the data,

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.533
which is just five simple numbers.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:02.475
You can imagine this as a one to five scale rating at a restaurant,

00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:04.230
and the height of each bar is

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.780
how many individuals provide the rating shown at the bottom.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.239
We see here, ornamented chart axes that obscure the actual

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:18.269
values,and also the use of textures on both the bars and the background.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:21.119
Another type of charred junk skews the message

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.945
and makes it difficult to understand the real data being displayed.

00:01:24.944 --> 00:01:28.119
The teeth here are an example of this type of chart junk.
