00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.234
Visual encodings are mapping from data to display elements.

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:09.750
Display elements include position on the x axis or y axis,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.759
the size of points or bars,

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.379
the shape of points,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.490
texture, angle, length and many more.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:20.339
The question is, how to take our data and

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.719
best display it to an audience using these elements.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.570
Researchers have studied how to best convey

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.530
data so that an audience understands the message.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.899
Two of the most effective methods for showing

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.009
quantitative data are the position along an axis, and length.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.820
Therefore, creating visualizations that are

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.475
accurate in these encodings is really important.

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:50.300
Additionally, humans are drawn strongly to contrast in color.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.274
So color should be reserved for drawing the eye of your audience to a key finding,

00:00:55.274 --> 00:01:00.949
and not for differing the bars of a bar chart with no message as shown here.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.980
These colors do nothing for providing context of the underlying data.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.450
Here, you can see an appropriate use of color for

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.695
identifying the difference between different distributions of points.

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:18.464
The color highlights the difference for the audience to quickly understand.

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:25.939
Charts that have arching angles or compare based on areas can easily deceive us.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.259
You commonly see angles based on areas in a pie chart or pie type charts.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.430
You actually saw a chart that was deceiving in terms of area

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.935
and angles in the introduction video of this lesson.

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:40.320
In the next concepts,

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.009
we will put these to practice and see what makes a good visual.
