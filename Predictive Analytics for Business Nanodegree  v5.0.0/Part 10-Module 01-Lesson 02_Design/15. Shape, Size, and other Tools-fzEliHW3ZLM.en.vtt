00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Now that you've seen the use of color and visuals,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.290
let's look at a few additional encodings.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.035
Sometimes you'll need additional encodings to distinguish data in a visual.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:15.109
For these cases, you might want to use different encoding such as shape or size.

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.710
In a scatter plot,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.289
we might change the size or shape of the markers.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.280
In this video, you will learn about some additional encodings.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.170
When you're making scatter plot,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.135
you're representing the data with dots,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:28.665
or maybe some other symbol.

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:34.774
Here, we are comparing the average SAT scores for students at different universities.

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:38.609
Each point is the information of a single university.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.909
Right now, the visual encoding of the data is oppositional,

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.564
only using the x and y axes.

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:47.439
If these are the only two columns we want to encode,

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:52.229
I can't imagine a visual that paints the relationship in a more clear way.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.299
However, we could introduce

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.774
additional encodings to show additional features in our dataset.

00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:01.519
Say whether the school is private or public.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.705
Now, imagine we also want to understand

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:07.060
the student-faculty ratios associated with each school.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.120
We will need another encoding.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.930
Even though we get a lot of information from the marker size,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.075
it's not a very accurate representation.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:19.590
It can also be ambiguous as to how the size should be interpreted.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.025
Should the viewer be comparing the diameter of the marker or the area?

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:28.795
Data can also be encoded using different shapes,

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.129
but we don't encode quantitative data with shapes as we

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:36.299
probably run out of the number of shapes to encode our values.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.254
You would instead need to change your data to a categorical ordinal variable,

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:44.804
and encoding quantitative data with color can be confusing.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.220
Look at this example.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.859
The shapes are not as great as color for differentiating the schools,

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.829
and the colors here are hardly an indicator of all the different student-faculty ratios.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.780
In general, color and shape are best used for categorical variables,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.540
while the size of the marker can assist in adding

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.470
additional quantitative data as we demonstrated here.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.979
I personally try to avoid these types of encodings if possible.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.219
But sometimes these additional encodings are necessary.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.229
If you start to lose the message,

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:22.629
consider breaking your visual into more visuals that each conveys its own direct message.
