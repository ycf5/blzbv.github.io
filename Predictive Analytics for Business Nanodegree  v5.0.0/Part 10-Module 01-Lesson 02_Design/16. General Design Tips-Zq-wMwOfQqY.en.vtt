00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.169
When you're building data visualizations for explanatory purposes, focus on simplicity.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.928
We can make good visuals by avoiding making bad visuals.

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:12.810
And that might seem like silly advice,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.100
but the key to good visualizations is considering your data-ink ratio,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.245
your visual encodings, and keeping the data integrity.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:26.589
Further advice is to focus your audience attention on the purpose of your visualization.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.964
If the insight isn't easily apparent,

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:32.490
then your visualization is probably too complicated.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.539
Remove the extras and focus on conveying your message.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.039
Only use color where necessary.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.100
If there isn't additional information being

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.255
gained by the audience member from the use of color,

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:47.380
this is an indication you probably don't need it.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.440
A reminder that the design techniques in this lesson are focused on explanatory visuals.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:54.134
In the upcoming lessons,

00:00:54.134 --> 00:00:57.369
you will learn to build data visualizations in Tableau.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:01.919
Often, these visuals are created with a tool for exploratory purposes.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.939
For final analysis, you should consider moving the insight of

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.980
this tool to your audience using something with less distractions.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.375
These tools often have a lot going on and the extras can distract from your insight.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:17.924
This is a beautiful dashboard.

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:21.254
But if you are trying to highlight a particular insight from it,

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:23.549
I'm distracted by all the colors.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.164
The fact that there are so many different parts is overwhelming.

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.130
And since I'm not familiar with the data,

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:33.129
I don't even know where to start with what question is being answered.

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:37.299
This leads nicely into the final points of this lesson. Data storytelling.
