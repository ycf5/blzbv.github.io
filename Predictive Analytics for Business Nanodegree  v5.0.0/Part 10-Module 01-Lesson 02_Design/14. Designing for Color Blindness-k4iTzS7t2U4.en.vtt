00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.804
Humans perceive color through signals produced by cells in the retina called cones.

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:07.514
Light comes into the eye,

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:11.925
hits the cones and the cones set off electrical signals to the brain.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:14.895
There are typically three types of cones, S,

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:18.324
M and L, for short, medium and long.

00:00:18.324 --> 00:00:23.144
They are sensitive to different frequencies or colors of light.

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:25.350
Short cones prefer blue,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.840
medium prefer green and long prefer red.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.030
However around 10% of men and 1% of women,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.185
have mutations that affect these cones and produce what is known as colorblindness.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:39.495
The most common form,

00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:41.549
is a red green colorblindness,

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:46.974
typically caused by the medium cone shifting sensitivity towards red light.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:50.945
This mutation is something you can read more about in the instructor notes below.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.380
People with this condition,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.780
can't distinguish between red and green,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.765
as shown in this image of a red and a green apple.

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:03.054
There is actually a pretty large fraction of people that are colorblind.

00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:06.174
So you should design your visualizations to include them.

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:10.560
Try to stay away from red green palettes and use blue orange instead.
