00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.294
In the previous example,

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:07.320
we saw how we can better our visualizations by removing extraneous elements.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.714
We can conceptualize this relationship using something called the data-to-ink ratio.

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:17.384
The data-to-ink ratio was defined in 1983 by Edward Tufte,

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.130
as the ratio of the amount of ink used to describe

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:23.230
the data to the total amount of ink in the visual.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.449
In general, the higher the data-to-ink ratio, the better.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.879
This means that a large amount of the ink in the

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.045
visual is being used to actually describe the data,

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:36.315
while low data-ink ratio suggests that you are using

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:41.439
ink that is added for other purposes rather than describing the data.

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.009
These elements should be removed.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.914
Let's take a look at an example.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:50.234
Here, we have two graphs that are representing the same information.

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:54.619
On the left, we have a visualization with low data-to-ink ratio.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.089
Notice the extra elements in the visualization that can

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.865
be removed including the blue background,

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:01.965
the horizontal and vertical grid lines,

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:03.985
and the outer black border.

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:08.715
A large amount of the ink in this visualization is not used to describe the data.

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.400
On the right, we see a visualization with

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.825
the same data but with a high data-to-ink ratio.

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.515
The visual on the right only has ink used to

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:20.695
directly relate to the understanding of the data.

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:25.379
Comparing both visualizations, the one on the right is not only more

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:30.269
pleasing to the eye but it is also much easier to understand.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.804
When we're building data visualizations,

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:36.680
we always want to strive for a high data-ink ratio.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.300
Let's go through a few more examples on how we can

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.390
take a visualization with low data-to-ink ratio,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.599
or extraneous elements, and reduce it down to

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.464
something that is much simpler and easier to understand.

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:51.689
In this example, we're going to take

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.024
a visualization and try to improve its data-to-ink ratio.

00:01:56.025 --> 00:02:01.700
Here, we have a bar chart representing the number of calories for various types of foods.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.034
At first glance, we can see examples of

00:02:04.034 --> 00:02:07.560
bad visualization techniques that we've discussed previously,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.465
such as the busy background,

00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:11.039
the poor color choices,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.199
and the use of 3D gradients.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.394
Let's walk through it step by step as to how we can simplify

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:20.939
this visualization and increase its data-to-ink ratio.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.180
First, let's remove the wood background from

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.240
the outside and this gray background from the inside,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.150
increasing contrast and legibility.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.480
We can also remove redundant labels such as this legend from the titles.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.914
This information is encoded elsewhere.

00:02:37.914 --> 00:02:39.949
Now that we have removed the backgrounds,

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:44.814
the heavy borders separating the various elements are no longer necessary.

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:46.439
So let's take those out too.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.175
Remember our coloring theory.

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.700
We shouldn't use more than one or two colors in

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.649
a visualization unless it's encoded some value in the data.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.219
The color of these bars don't reflect any differences between the different foods.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.625
So let's remove those colors as well,

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:04.534
except for the food of interest.

00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:06.629
In this case, bacon.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.699
Great. We've already improved

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.744
the data-to-ink ratio quite a bit but there's more that we can do.

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:17.585
Recall that 3D graphs including gradients and shadowing can be misleading.

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:22.340
So let's flatten out these bars and remove the drop shadows to make it more clear.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.539
We can also make the data stand out by

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.560
reducing the boldness of these labels and grid lines.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.935
If we want to go even further,

00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:33.060
we can remove the lines entirely and encode the label

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.080
values directly into the bars, like this.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.820
Comparing the two visualization side by side,

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.389
you can easily see the effect of improving the data-to-ink ratio.

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.854
The visualization with the high data-to-ink ratio is far more clear,

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:54.000
more interpretable, and has all the elements you need for a great visualization.
