00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.950
Bad data visualizations can be summed up as visuals that don't convey your message well.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.464
If a visualization is misleading or hides and distracts your message,

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:14.900
you need to consider changes to your visualization.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.629
Let's look at some misleading examples.

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:21.544
This is a popular image for showing bad visualizations.

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:25.220
Here, you can see that this plot is misleading by making

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:31.054
a small difference seem much larger than it actually is by zooming in on the difference.

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:35.924
This is a poor visualization due to the fact that it's misleading.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:38.614
A second example was made popular by Cole,

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.329
who we mentioned in an earlier concept.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.509
Consider these two pie charts for understanding how

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:49.869
a summer science camp for kids impacts their interests on learning about science.

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:54.909
Can you tell if the camp was effective in raising the interest rates in science?

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.919
This is an example of a visual that hides or distracts from the message.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.420
Comparing the areas of the pie charts and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.530
all the colors make it difficult to see the message.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.715
Another plot from Cole's book is this pie chart.

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:15.245
You might guess that this piece of the pie is the largest in terms of the suppliers.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:16.484
You would be wrong,

00:01:16.484 --> 00:01:18.444
it's actually this piece.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:21.334
The 3D aspect of the chart is misleading.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:27.669
And, again, humans are not great at identifying differences based on these areas.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.849
Here is an example of a race track chart.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.169
Though one bar is clearly longer than the other,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.525
they represent the same percentage.

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:39.685
This makes for some confusion.

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:44.725
Additionally, the bright red here suggests that this group is more important.

00:01:44.724 --> 00:01:46.289
If this isn't the case,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.575
then this coloring seems misleading.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.055
With just two bars,

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:55.099
we might not even need a chart but rather just a statement of the message.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.480
Visualizations become more useful as

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.600
the amount of information we need to convey increases.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.069
At the same time,

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.619
adding extra elements to the visuals that do

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.680
not convey the message in your data should be avoided.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.750
I urge you to strive for elegance and simplicity in your visuals.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.574
Here, you saw some examples of poor visuals.

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:19.139
You might have some ideas of how to improve these already.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.000
We will look at some improved visuals in the upcoming concepts.
