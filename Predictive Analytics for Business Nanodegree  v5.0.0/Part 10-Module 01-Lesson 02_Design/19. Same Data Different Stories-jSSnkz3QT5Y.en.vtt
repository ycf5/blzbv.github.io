00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.933
Database Scene one, take one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.170
Here is a bar chart providing the likely places you lost your remote control.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.368
You can see that the most likely place you will find the remote,

00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:10.298
is actually in your hand.

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:14.818
While the least likely is that it's gone forever and you'll never find it.

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:16.904
Other options for where your remote might be,

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:21.443
are shown here in descending order.

00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:23.248
Let's try again. Database scene one take two.

00:00:23.248 --> 00:00:30.279
Have you ever been looking for a hat and find out that you're already wearing it?

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.758
Or looking for your keys and find out they're in your back pocket?

00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:37.958
Or looking for your backpack and you find out that it's on your back?

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.303
Turns out losing your remote is the same problem.

00:00:41.303 --> 00:00:45.324
This chart highlights the seven places your remote is likely to be.

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:48.083
The top place, is in your hand.

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:51.879
The least likely place that it is, is lost forever.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.525
But before you think you were one of those two people,

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:56.693
make sure you check under the couch,

00:00:56.693 --> 00:00:59.154
next to the TV, in the fridge,

00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:01.718
in your shirt pocket and under the rug.

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:04.253
Before you blame the dog for eating your remote,

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:08.693
or think an alien came from space and stole your remote, check your hand.

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:11.049
It's unlikely your remote is gone forever.
