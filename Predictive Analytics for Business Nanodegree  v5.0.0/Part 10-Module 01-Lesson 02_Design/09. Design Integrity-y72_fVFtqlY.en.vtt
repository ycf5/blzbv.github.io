00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.120
It is your duty to present your data in the most truthful way possible?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.719
People can and do lie with their visualizations to deceive others.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.160
One of the most common methods is in distorting the area of charts.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.640
Here's an example from Fox News that was created in 2012.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.135
The chart here is attempting to show you the change in tax rate.

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:24.275
It looks like a huge change.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.640
Something like five times increase.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.310
However, if you look at the actual numbers,

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.609
it's only 35 percent to 39.6 percent.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.655
A 13 percent increase or 4.6 percentage points.

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:42.270
Humans tend to assume that the baseline of a bar chart is set to zero.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.105
Here, the baseline was set to 34 percent,

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:47.719
which is out of line with our assumptions.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.379
The creator of this graphic,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.840
likely meant to deceive viewers into believing

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.130
the tax rate change was much larger than it actually was.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.005
This brings us to the lie factor,

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.515
a concept introduced by Edward Tufte in Visual Display.

00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:02.954
Yup, him again.

00:01:02.954 --> 00:01:05.495
You really should find this book if you haven't yet.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:08.579
The lie factor compares the size of the effect in

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.825
a graphic to the size of the effect in the data.

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:15.030
By effect, I mean the difference you're comparing.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.025
For example, you're comparing the heights of the bars in the tax rate chart.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:23.580
So the effect would be how much taller the right bar is than the left bar.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.620
To calculate the lie factor,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.375
you divide the effect size by the graphic with the effect size by the data.

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:31.935
As an example of this,

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:33.329
I'll use this figure,

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.174
which is also a great example of chart junk.

00:01:36.174 --> 00:01:41.625
It's actually ambiguous which aspect of the doctor images is encoded in the data.

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:44.120
The height, the area,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.585
it turns out the height of the doctors is proportional to the percentages.

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:54.359
But we actually perceive the visual area as the encoding for the data.

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.730
Since we're comparing the area of the doctors,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.730
I'll use that to calculate the graphical effect.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.680
Making a rectangle around this largest doctor,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.490
it's 437 pixels tall and 181 pixels wide.

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.969
So it has an area of around 79,000 square pixels.

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.689
The middle doctor has an area around 30,500 square

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:21.175
pixels and the smallest doctor is 16,500 square pixels.

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:26.640
Let's work out the lie factor for the comparison between 1964 and 1990.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.619
The visual effect is how much larger the doctor is in 1964.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:40.069
That is 79,000 minus 16,500 divided by 16,500 or 3.79.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.629
So the difference between the size of the doctors is

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.319
379 percent the size of the smaller doctor.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:54.229
The effect size and the actual data is 27 minus 12 divided by 12, or 1.25.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:03:00.539
So the difference in the data is 125 percent larger than the 1990 data point.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:05.129
Dividing these, the lie factor is 3.0 or 3.

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.019
Any lie factor greater than 1 suggests that your visual is misleading.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.370
The larger the factor,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.050
the more misleading the visual.
