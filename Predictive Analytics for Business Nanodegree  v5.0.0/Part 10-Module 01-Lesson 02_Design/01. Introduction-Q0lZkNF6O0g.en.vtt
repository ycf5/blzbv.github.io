00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.400
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.100
you learned some basic principles
about representing data graphically.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.970
Now you're going to learn how
to design your visualizations.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.170
Proper design is essential to
convey your story to others.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.530
Check out this thing,
it's saying something.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.590
What are these wedges indicating,
I don't know.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.150
The length of the color sections
don't make sense either.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.830
Somehow 156 is the same as 292,
and almost as large as 957,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.600
then to read this text you have
to turn your head over weird.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.884
Here Fox News is indicating that
the tax rate would increase by 5 times,

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:37.276
except that the change
is only from 35 to 39%.

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:40.893
You assume the bottom of the graph
of is 0, but here it's actually 34%.

00:00:40.893 --> 00:00:42.942
Thus leading us into believing
this is huge change,

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.870
when it's actually quite small.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.980
These are examples of poor design.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.860
In this lesson, I'll show you how
to avoid making these mistakes and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.450
instead, design your visualizations
to be informative, accurate and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.120
visually appealing.
