00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
One thing you might have noticed when working with Inner Joins is that the data you

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.849
join can have a one to one or a one to many relationship.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.490
In other words, one account might only have placed

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.860
a single order while another account might have placed many orders.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.895
Since we're focused primarily on the orders,

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.755
you probably missed a different kind of relationship.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:23.610
A few of these accounts have just developed brand new relationships with

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.035
Parch and Posy Sales Team and haven't placed any orders yet.

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:28.935
So, when we join these tables,

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.150
what happens to the accounts without any orders?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.060
Where do they go?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.730
It turns out you might want to keep them around or drop

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.390
them from your result set depending on what you're going for.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.245
For example, if you're simply attaching account names to each order,

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:46.925
then excluding these accounts without orders is probably fine.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:49.890
That's exactly what we did in our Inner Join earlier.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.990
If your goal is to count up all of the accounts in

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.690
the region along with their quantities of paper purchased,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.895
you might want to include the accounts without any orders.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:00:59.745
This is done using an Outer Join.

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:02.340
In the next section, I'll show you a few different types of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.770
Joins and give the opportunity to practice writing some yourself.
