00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.815
To understand what JOINS are and why they're helpful,

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:05.850
let's think about Parch and Posey's orders table.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.500
Looking back at this table,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.630
you'll notice that none of the orders say the name of the customer.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.560
Instead, the table refers to customers by numerical values in the account ID column.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.615
We'll need to join another table in order to connect this data to names.

00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:24.265
But first, why isn't the customer's name in this table in the first place?

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:27.255
There are a few reasons that someone might have made the decision to separate

00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:31.650
orders from the information about the customers placing those orders.
