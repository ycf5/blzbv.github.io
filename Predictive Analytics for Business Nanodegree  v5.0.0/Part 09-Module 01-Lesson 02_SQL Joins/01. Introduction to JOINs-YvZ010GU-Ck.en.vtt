00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.905
Up to this point, we've only been working with one table at a time.

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:08.990
But the real power of SQL comes from working with data across multiple tables at once.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.100
The term relational database refers to

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.489
the fact that tables within it relate to one another.

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.590
They contain common identifiers that allow

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.535
information from multiple tables to be easily combined.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:24.450
Keeping all of a company's data, from purchasing transactions,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.370
to employee job satisfaction,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.795
to inventory in a single Excel dataset doesn't make a ton of sense.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:33.720
The table would hold a ton of information and it'd be hard

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.500
to determine a row call and structure for so many different types of data.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.925
Databases give us the flexibility to keep things organized neatly in their own tables,

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:46.380
so that they're easy to find and work with while also allowing us to

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.395
combine tables as needed to solve problems that require several types of data.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.430
In this lesson, we're going to take a look at

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.200
how to leverage SQL to link tables together.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.370
You're about to see why SQL is one of the most popular environments for

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.550
working with data as we learn how to write what are known as Joints.
