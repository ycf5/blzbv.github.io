00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
For the following example,

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.680
I'll use small subsets of the Accounts and Orders tables shown here.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.995
First, let's quickly recap the INNER JOIN.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:14.480
This will return only rows that appear in both tables.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.650
Writing the following INNER JOIN query to join the Accounts and Orders tables will

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.245
pull these columns from the Accounts table and these columns from the Orders table,

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.640
nly for the values of the account ID in

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.360
the Orders table that match with the ID field in the accounts table.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.570
This will pull these three rows from

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.320
the Accounts table and match them with these five rows from the Orders table.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.870
So the table we'll get back will look like this.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.840
Notice we have only the three account IDs that were in both tables.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.709
A common way to visualize different JOINs is with a Venn diagram.

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:56.650
Each circle in the diagram represents a table.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.925
The left circle includes all rows of data in the table in our FROM clause,

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:02.910
which is the Orders table.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.770
The right circle represents all rows of data in the table in our JOIN clause.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.445
In this case, that's the Accounts table.

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:17.525
The overlapping middle section represents all rows for which the ON clause is true.

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:20.415
An INNER JOIN, as shown here,

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:25.440
will return only rows at the intersection of these two circles.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.665
So what about this new account that hasn't placed any orders, yet?

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.750
If we want to show that there are existing accounts

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.535
that do not appear in the Orders table,

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:34.560
an INNER JOIN is not going to help us.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.120
In the upcoming sections,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.590
we'll work with OUTER JOINs to pull that type of information.
