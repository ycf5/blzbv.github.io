00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.265
JOINS will make your queries a little bit more complicated.

00:00:03.265 --> 00:00:05.160
Let's break down all the parts of a JOIN to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.180
see what they do before you write some of your own.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.410
We'll start by writing what's called an INNER JOIN

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.950
and we'll move on to other types of JOINS shortly.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.070
In order to write a JOIN,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.250
the first thing will need are SELECT and FROM clauses just like any other query.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.180
In this case, we're looking to add account names to each order.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.035
So we'll start with the Orders table.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:28.375
You'll notice I'm running this query even though it's not yet finished.

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.270
This is an easy way to make sure I haven't made

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.925
any typos or errors in the first part of my query.

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:37.180
Since it worked, we can move on to write the JOIN.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.670
The next thing we need is a JOIN clause.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.485
You can think of this like a second FROM clause.

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.870
It identifies the table where the data that we want to join lives.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.190
In this case, account names live in the Accounts table,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.320
so that's what we've written.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.700
Finally, we need to specify the relationship between the two tables.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.535
This happens by writing a logical statement in the ON clause.

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:01.905
Now that the join is complete,

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:03.900
let's add some columns from the Accounts table

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.080
into our SELECT statement to complete the query.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.810
You can see that the results now contain information

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.350
about the orders and the accounts that placed them.
