00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.520
Remember in lesson one, we learned that
A B testing is a type of experiment

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.150
with two variants, A and B,
which are the Control and Variation.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.330
However, in this experiment,
we have three variants.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.020
The Control stores, and

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.819
the stores with facials offered at
$76.99, and those offered at $87.99.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.300
Additionally, the stores
are spread across three regions.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.430
To properly match our control and
treatment units, we'll need to separate

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.600
our data so we're really performing two
AB analyses, one for each price point.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.090
Therefore, we need to create a data
table that shows the stores,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.060
the region, and the group the store
was in, Control or treatment, and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.350
if treatment,
what was the price of the facial?
