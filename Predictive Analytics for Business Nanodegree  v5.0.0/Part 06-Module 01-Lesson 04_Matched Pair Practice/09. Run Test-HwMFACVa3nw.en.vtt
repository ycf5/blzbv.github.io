00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.062
We're now ready to run our test and
collect data from our stores for

00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:06.955
March 20th to May 28th.

00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:11.794
The first treatment group of stores will
change the price of their facials to

00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:17.327
76.99 and the second group will change
the price of their facials to 87.99.

00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:18.611
After collecting data for

00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:21.479
ten weeks, we'll be ready to
perform the A/B Analysis.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.140
Let's start by preparing our data.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.150
We have two data files
available to use our analysis.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.340
The point of sale transactions
file contains transaction data for

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.198
each invoice where each row contains
a line item for the invoice.

00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:41.834
The point of sale transaction file
has transactions from January 1st,

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:44.651
2013 through June 29th, 2014.

00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:48.186
We also have an Excel file with
information on the stores that we used

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:50.185
as treatment units.

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:53.730
This data file contains the store
identifier and the price level for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.740
facials at each store.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.767
We need to prepare the data, so we can
leverage the Altiris A/B Trend tool and

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:04.680
A/B Controls tool to create
sets of control stores

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.010
that we can use to compare
to the treatment units.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.959
Using our two data files,
we'll create three data files.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:16.658
The weekly store traffic for
the A/B Trend tool, the store list for

00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:21.607
the A/B Controls tool that will use
to match treatment units to control

00:01:21.607 --> 00:01:25.255
units and the sales data for
the A/B Analysis tool.

00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:29.897
To start with, we need to filter the
data to only include transactions from

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:33.591
February 7th,
2013 through May 28th, 2014.

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:39.933
Remember that the test period lasted ten
weeks from March 28th to May 28th, 2014.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:44.175
Data is arrogated to a weekly level
turn move missing values which

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:48.120
would cause the A/B Trend and
A/B Controls tools to error.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.434
First, we'll create a table that holds
the weekly store traffic information

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:55.783
that contains the number of
invoices per week at each store.

00:01:55.783 --> 00:02:00.407
We'll use this data with A/B Trend tool
to create measures of trend and seasonal

00:02:00.407 --> 00:02:04.637
patterns that can be used in helping
to match treatment to control units.

00:02:04.637 --> 00:02:06.779
For our analysis, we use the week and

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:09.693
week begin fields to
calculate the weekend date.

00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:12.609
The weekend date is the field
that we need for analysis, but

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.183
we might be able to use the other dates,
so we'll leave them in our data.

00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:20.027
Next, we need to create a data table
that shows the stores, the region and

00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:22.941
the group that the store is in,
controller treatment.

00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:26.424
And if treatment, what was the price
of the facial at that store?

00:02:26.424 --> 00:02:30.450
This data will be used with the A/B
Controls tool using information from

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.552
the A/B Trends tool to create control
treatment pairs for the analysis.

00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:38.670
Finally, we'll aggregate the sales data,
to show the weekly sales and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.519
gross margin per store of all
transactions that included a facial to

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.820
perform an analysis.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.520
Sounds like a lot data preparation, but
it's much less work than it sounds.
