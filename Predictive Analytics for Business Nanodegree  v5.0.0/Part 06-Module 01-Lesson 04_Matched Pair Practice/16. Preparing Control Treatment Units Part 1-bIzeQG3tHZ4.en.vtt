00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.410
Now that our data has been prepared and

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.650
organized, the next step is to determine
our control treatment store pairs.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.740
It's important to think about
differences between stores that would

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.620
assist in properly matching control and
treatment stores.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.220
Variables that were deemed important for
the day spa facial test were the store's

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.740
sales trend, matching the stores based
on foot traffic, the seasonality of

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.070
sales, matching stores with similar
seasonal traffic patterns, and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.890
geographic region, to control for
regional customer preferences.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.670
Let's create a new workflow and
bring in our weekly store traffic data.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.720
As we discussed earlier,
numeric measures are needed

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.140
in order to match treatment
stores to control candidates.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.720
Two of the best measures to
use are trend and seasonality.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.570
In this example,
we'll use weekly store traffic data,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.640
which we created in the data preparation
workflow, to calculate these measures.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.670
First, let's drag an AB Trend
tool onto the canvas and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.670
connect it to our data stream.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.915
Select Store as the unit identifier,

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:08.489
Week_End as the reporting period and
Count as the performance measure to use.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.040
For the report period type,
select Weekly for the period, and

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.240
we're going to use 6 as the number
of periods to calculate the trend.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.260
The AB Trend tool uses a rolling average
and six weeks covers any variations

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.870
during a month,
as a month could have up to five weeks.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.600
Select March 20th as
the test start date.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.580
This date represents
the date the test started.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.300
In other words,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.520
the date you started offering facials at
different prices, and let's the AB Trend

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.290
tool know that it needs to use data
up to this date to calculate trends.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.735
After configuring the AB Trend tool,
let's run the workflow to

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:51.100
ensure we have enough data and
periods to calculate results correctly.
