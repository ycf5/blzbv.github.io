00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.105
2 treatment price points were tested,

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:08.105
87.99 and
76.99 versus the control price of 98.99.

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:11.675
Having done two tests,
we're going to analyze each price point.

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.739
The results of each will be compared
to each other focusing on gross margin

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:16.597
performance.

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:20.310
We're going to use the two datasets
that we previously created.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.340
The control treatment pairs data will
be used to provide identification data

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.564
concerning which stores were
controller treatment units and

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:31.222
the store sales analysis data will
be used to provide performance data

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:34.080
associated with the control,
and treatment stores.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.535
Using input data tools, let's bring both
data sets into a new Altiris workflow.

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:42.229
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:47.604
Since we conducted two tests,
one at 87.99 and the other 76.99, we

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:52.989
need to split the control treatment pair
data into 2 streams 1 for each test.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.232
Let's drag a filter tool
on to the Canvas and

00:00:56.232 --> 00:01:00.627
we'll use a basic filter
of test group equals 87.99.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.647
This will result in the true output
streaming the data for the 87.99 test,

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.830
then the false output streaming data for
the 76.99 test.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.390
Next, let's drag an A/B Analysis
tool onto the Canvas.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.090
The A/B Analysis tool will provide
reports that detail how the treatment

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.480
units performed versus
the control units for a test.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.810
First, connect the filter tool true
output to the A/B Analysis C and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.449
T inputs.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.120
The C input is the controls input
that provides the A/B Analysis tool

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.300
with a unique identifier for
each control unit.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.615
The T input is a treatment input
that provides an identifier are for

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:40.045
treatment inputs.

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:44.235
The T input provides an identifier for
the treatment units.

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:48.107
Since all of the data for the treatment
and control stores is in the data

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:51.861
stream, we can connect the filter
output to both the C and T inputs.

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:56.716
First, we're going to setup the 87.99
analysis and we'll repeat the steps for

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.109
the 76.99 group.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.790
So, let's connect the sales
data to the P input.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.440
The P input provides
the A/B Analysis tool

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.289
with performance data associated with
the control and treatment units.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.050
So let's configure
the A/B Analysis tool.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.700
In the control section, select
the control's field for the control unit

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.290
identifier and the treatment's field for
the treatment unit mapping field.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.302
In the treatment section,

00:02:21.302 --> 00:02:25.167
select the treatment's field as
the treatment unit identifier.

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:30.127
In the performance data section,
will you store as the unit identifier?

00:02:30.127 --> 00:02:35.309
Weekend is the reporting period date and
gross margin as the performance measure.

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:39.620
Clicking on the Test Dates tab,
we need to enter the dates of the test.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.899
Note that this test refers to
the dates of the experiment and

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.744
not the dates of the data we have.

00:02:44.744 --> 00:02:47.878
Since we ran the test from March 20th,
2014,

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:51.521
until May 28, 2014,
we'll enter those dates here.

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:54.961
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:58.927
The additional information tab can be
used to add text for the report output,

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:02.255
but we'll leave that blank for
this example.

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:06.505
And similarly, the graphics option tab
can be used to adjust the report and

00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:10.005
automatically save it, but
we'll let you explore those features.

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:14.247
After repeating the steps for
the 7699 test,

00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:17.768
we'll add a Browse tool to the I
output of both A/B Analysis tools.

00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:21.997
The I output produces an HTML based

00:03:21.997 --> 00:03:24.398
interactive dashboard
of the test results.

00:03:24.398 --> 00:03:28.039
We'll also add a browse tool to the O
output of both A/B Analysis tools.

00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:32.828
The O output produces a textual
summary of the test results,

00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:37.428
basic summary statistics and a few
visualizations related to the results.

00:03:37.428 --> 00:03:40.908
Now, we can run the workflow to
produce the textual and HTML reports.
