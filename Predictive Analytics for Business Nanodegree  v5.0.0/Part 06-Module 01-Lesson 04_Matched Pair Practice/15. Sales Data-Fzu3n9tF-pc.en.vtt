00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.890
Since we already filtered
the transactions that included facials

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.770
when creating the store data, we can
reuse that output for the sales data.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.108
We want to aggregate the transaction
data to the store week level.

00:00:12.108 --> 00:00:13.908
So let's add a summarize tool and

00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:17.750
connect it to the filter tool
that checks for facials.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.010
We can group by region store
in our data information, and

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.280
we'll sum our gross margin and
sales information.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.790
We now have a data set that we wanted
that shows the gross margin in sales for

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.550
each store, for all transactions
that included a facial per week.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.660
Now we can drag an output tool onto
the canvas and save the data for

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.730
later use in a file named
store sales analysis data.
