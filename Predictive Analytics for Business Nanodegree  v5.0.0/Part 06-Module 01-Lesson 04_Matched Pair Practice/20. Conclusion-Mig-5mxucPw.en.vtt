00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.030
We just completed the lesson on
matched pair design experiments, and

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.920
the course on A/B testing.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.750
Let's review what we've
covered in this lesson.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.850
Building on what we learned in the last
lesson, we walked through a pricing

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.410
elasticity problem, and learned
about using discrete variables and

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.850
trends to help match treatment and
control units in an experiment.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.240
We also demonstrated the ability
to perform two tests in parallel.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.110
You've now completed
the course on A/B testing, and

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.570
know how to set up and conduct two types
of A/B testing experiments and analyze

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.260
the results to determine significance
to support your business decisions.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.830
You're definitely ready to demonstrate
your understanding of A/B testing.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.320
Excellent job.
