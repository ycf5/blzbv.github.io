00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.790
Price elasticity of demand is
a measure used in economics to show

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.380
the responsiveness, or elasticity,
of the quantity demanded of a good or

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.100
service to the change in its price.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.320
We can use A/B testing to analyze
whether a change in price

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.610
impacts the quantity of a good or
service as a result.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.900
Remember, A/B testing analyzes whether a
change applied to an experimental group,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.880
is statistically different
from a control group.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.830
Measuring the impact of a change,
before applying it broadly,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.020
could be useful in minimizing the
potential negative impact of a change.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.230
For instance, if you're thinking
of running a promotion,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.500
you would run a test
on a subset of stores,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.390
to determine if a promotion had
a positive impact on profit.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420
If the test showed positive results,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.690
you would roll out the changes
to the rest of your stores.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.330
Let's work through a detailed problem.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.300
Imagine that you work for
a chain of spas.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.820
You're part of a team looking for
ways to increase the gross margin, and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.370
you've decide to experiment
with the price of facials.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.450
Currently, your stores offer facials for
98.99, and you'd

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.670
like to predict whether a change in
price would yield greater gross margin.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.870
You've been asked to predict
the gross margin change

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.830
if the facials were at 87.99 or 76.99.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.300
We need to creat an A/B test that will
help us predict the gross margin change,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.970
with different prices of facials,
assuming that the average customer

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.540
visits a store about
once every ten weeks.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.880
Remember the process for A/B testing?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.150
First, we'll select the treatment and
control units.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.680
Then, we'll prepare and run the test.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.760
And lastly, we'll analyse the results.
