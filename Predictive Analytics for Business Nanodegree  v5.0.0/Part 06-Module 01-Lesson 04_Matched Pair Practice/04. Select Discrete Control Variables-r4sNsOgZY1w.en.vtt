00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.440
In our experiment,
we selected the treatment units, and

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.280
all the other stores will continue
to offer facials at $98.99.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.030
They will all be used as
possible control stores.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.290
Once we collect the data, we'll use
tools to help us match control stores

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.150
to treatment stores based on
some continuous measures,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.840
as well as some discreet variables.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.880
We need to think through
the variables that we're going

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.520
to use to match the Control
units to the Treatment units.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.550
Let's take a look at our data and
see if we can come up with a plan.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.080
Looking at the historical data
available to us, we see that we have

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.650
the SKU_category which helps us
identify transactions with facials.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.250
We also have the Gross_margin and
Sales number for each Invoice.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.270
Although, we need to aggregate it.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.920
And finally, we have the region
that each store is in.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.470
Looking at the region field,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.010
we need to determine if the region
has any type of impact on sales.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.310
In other words, did the demographics
around stores in the east region

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.720
result in differing sales trends for
facials than in other regions.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.590
In this case, our assumption is going
to be that the region does create

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.710
differences in store performance.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.720
Otherwise, we wouldn't group
our stores into regions.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.530
Discrete variables can't be used to
match treatments to controls directly.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.520
To accommodate discrete variables,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.970
the units need to be matched with those
that share a discrete characteristic.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.519
For example, matching treatments to
controls for each region separately.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.220
Therefore, when we perform a matching,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.400
we're going to match stores by
region to ensure the best results.
