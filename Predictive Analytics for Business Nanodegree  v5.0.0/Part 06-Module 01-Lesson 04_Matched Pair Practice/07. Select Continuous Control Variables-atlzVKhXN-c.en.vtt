00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.530
Next, let's discuss matching
stores based on continuous trends.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.530
While we can use the average sales per
month, we might get a better match

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.640
if we could also measure trends
over time of some of our variables.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.150
Two commonly used measures for

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.519
using trends are growth in store traffic
and seasonal patterns in sales volume.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.960
In our problem,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.250
we'll use the number of invoices per
week to indicate traffic in the stores.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.970
And we'll use total sales per store
per week to help us measure and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.260
compare sales trends.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.430
Fortunately for us,
there's a tool in Alteryx that

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.400
will help us create measures of
trend and seasonal patterns.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.660
One value per test unit,
such as a store or

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.810
customer, that we can use to
match treatment to control units.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.860
When thinking of the duration
of your experiment,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.790
you should take into account that the AB
Trends Tool in Alteryx needs an entire

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.580
year of data plus a minimum 6 periods
in addition to the year is required.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.333
For example, if your experiment is
14 weeks long, you would need 6

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:07.857
weeks of historical data plus
52 weeks for calculating trends.

00:01:07.857 --> 00:01:11.311
58 weeks of historical data
would be needed to analyze 14

00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:13.010
weeks of experimental data.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.670
Make sure you understand the
requirements of your analysis tool when

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.720
designing an experiment as you may want
more data for different size periods.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.340
See the Alteryx help page for
more information on the AB Trend Tool.

00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:31.200
Lastly, it's important to
consider the normal cycle for

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.689
what you're trying to test when
determining how long to run a test.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.850
For instance, if a customer visits the
store weekly, the test should be run for

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.280
at least a week.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.010
If they purchase a service on a monthly
basis, you'd want to run your test for

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.700
at least a month.
