00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Now, we'll combine the data from all the regions using the Union Tool.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.540
Since all the data streams are the same,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.540
no configuration is needed of the Union Tool.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.640
Let's run the workflow and take a look at the output.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.835
Looking at the output of the Union Tool,

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.790
we can see that we have the control treatment pairs.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.180
However, we need to add the store attribute information from

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.690
the store information data to perform the analysis.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.080
Let's drag a Join Tool onto the canvas and join

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.640
the output from the Union Tool with the store information data stream.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.260
Well, join the Treatment field from

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.945
the Union Tool to the Store field from the store data,

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:42.320
and then we'll remove

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.460
the right Store field because we don't need the store information twice.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.160
So let's run the workflow and see what our output looks like now.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.774
We now have a data set that can be used to perform the analysis,

00:00:55.774 --> 00:01:00.560
a list of control and treatment pairs with the region and associated test group.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.075
Let's drag an Output Tool onto the canvas and save the data file for later use.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:10.230
We're now ready to perform the analysis and summarize the results of the test.
