00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.969
Now that you know how to
set up experiments and

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.530
perform matched pair design, we're going
to take your knowledge a step further.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.680
We're going to show you how to
think about non-numeric variables

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.860
that may have an impact
on your matching,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.520
as well as discuss using
trends over time to match.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.790
In this lesson, we're going to
give you a chance to practice what

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.400
you've learned so far, and introduce
some new concepts along the way,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.430
using a pricing elasticity
business problem.
