00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.343
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:03.343 --> 00:00:05.176
Now, let's bring in our store list data.

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:07.631
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:08.693
Using a join tool,

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:13.040
let's connect the weekly traffic
data to the store list data.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.430
Let's join using the store field,
and deselect the right store input,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.210
as we don't need two columns for
the store field in our data stream.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.810
We also wanted to use
region as a variable.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.500
Since this is a categorical variable,
the way to approach the data is to match

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.810
control and treatment stores
separately by each region.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.619
For each region,
the steps will be the same.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.670
First, filter out the region-specific
data using the filter tool,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.149
using a basic filter where
region equals Midwest.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.150
In order to use the AB controls tool,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.693
we need to separate the treatment
stores from the control group.

00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:48.255
So let's drag another
filter onto the canvas and

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:51.140
create a filter where the test
group does not equal CC.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.810
This will split our data stream into two
streams, one with the treatment stores,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.970
and one with the control stores.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.490
So the t output has
the treatment stores, and

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.860
the false output has the control stores.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.050
Now, we can use the AB control
tools to use the trend and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.350
seasonality data calculated
by the AB trend tool

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.680
to match each treatment store to
two control stores for each region.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.670
So let's drag an AB controls
tool onto the canvas.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.080
Connect the data with the treatment
stores to the t input.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.660
And the data with all the stores,
treatment and control, to the d input.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.370
Now let's configure in the tool.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.200
For the treatment unit identifier,
we'll select store.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.630
We're going to use both trend and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.419
seasonality to match
treatment to control stores.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.300
And we're going to match two control
stores to each treatment unit,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.040
where a control can only be matched
to a single treatment unit.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.100
We'll repeat these steps for
each region.
