00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.640
Continuing with the same workflow, we'll
add a filter tool to remove transactions

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.800
that do not include a facial.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.580
Earlier, using the summarize tool,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.160
we created a field called
facial flag that has one for

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.370
transactions that included a facial and
zero for transactions without a facial.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.290
We can connect our filter tool to
the output of the summarize tool, and

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.260
use a basic filter of facial flag
equals one to get the data we want.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.010
We can easily generate a unique list
of stores by using the summarize tool

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.860
again.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.870
Dragging a summarize
tool onto the canvas,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.090
we can group by region and store to get
a unique list of stores in each region.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.950
We would also like the store list to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.800
include whether the store
was a treatment store.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.800
This information is contained in
the treatment store's Excel file.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.410
Using the input data tool,
we can import this data.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.920
We only need the store and test group
information, so we'll use the select

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.710
tool to deselect price level and rename
the test price level to test group.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.680
Using a join tool we are able to add the
treatment store data to the main data

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.550
stream.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.400
Dragging the join tool onto the canvas
will join the data on the store field

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.690
and will deselect the right store field
since we don't need the store data

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.159
twice.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.430
Since we are joining the treatment store
data with data from all the stores

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.230
the join tool will produce two
data streams we are interested in.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.810
The L output will be the control
candidates stores, and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.325
the J output will be
the treatment stores.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:25.065
Looking at the L and

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:29.705
J outputs, we see that the L output
is missing the test group field.

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:33.705
We can use a formula tool to add a field
to identify the control candidate

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:34.935
stores.

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:37.660
Adding a formula field onto the canvas.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.400
Connected to the L output of the join
tool, and create a new field,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.500
with the same name and type as
the test group field, in the J output.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.490
For the expression type in CC.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.160
This will add the field
test group to the data.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.270
With a value of CC for
all the control stores.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.820
Next, let's combine
the two tables together.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.590
Since both tables have the same fields,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.990
we can easily combine the data
using the union tool.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.620
Connect the two streams
to the union tool.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.120
We now have the data set that we wanted,
a listing of stores with the region and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.590
test group associated with each store.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.760
Let's save the data using
an output data tool for later use.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.815
We'll save it as store list, .YXDB.
