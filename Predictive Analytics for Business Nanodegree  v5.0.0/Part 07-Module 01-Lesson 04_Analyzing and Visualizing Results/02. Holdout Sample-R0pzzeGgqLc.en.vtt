00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.120
A good way to validate your model's
ability to make a good forecast,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.060
is to use a holdout sample.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.710
Holdout sample is a subset
of the time series,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.510
usually the most recent data points,
that you withheld and

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.160
then used to check the accuracy
of predictions from your model.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.320
In our construction of the ETS and
ARIMA models from the previous lessons,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.060
we withheld the last six months from
our time series from model validation.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.750
We then built the model
using the remaining data and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.840
now we can test the results of the model
against the data in our holdout sample.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.190
This gives us actual observed
values to test against.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.760
The size of the holdout sample will
depend on how long the time series is

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.110
and how far you would like to forecast.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.320
Ideally, the size of the holdout sample
should be at least the amount of

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.680
periods you are forecasting for.
