00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.019
A residual in forecasting is the
difference between an observed value and

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.720
the forecasted value.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.550
A good time series forecasting
model showed two properties, first,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.920
the residuals in the models
are uncorrelated.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.220
Plotting a residuals in an ACF plot
will allow us to see if we have used

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.210
all of the information in
the time series for our model.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.600
There are auto correlations
in the residuals, and

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.490
there's information left that should be
use in tweaking our model construction.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.230
For example, in this plot,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.320
we can see that almost all of the lags
do not have a significant correlation.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.350
This next plot, we can see that many of
the lags are still strongly correlated.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.570
We would want to add term to our
model to help adjust for this.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.050
Second, the residuals should have a 0
mean or at least close to a 0 mean.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.305
If the residuals have a mean other
than 0, then the forecasts are biased.

00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:49.090
Adjusting for bias is easy.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.930
If the residuals have a mean other than
close to 0, then simply add the mean to

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.680
all the forecasts and
the bias problem is solved.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.450
Forecast models resulting in
residuals that do not contain these

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.020
characteristics have room for
improvement.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.300
Adding additional terms to our ETS or
Arima Model may alleviate this issue.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.030
After plotting the residuals
around our bookings Arima Model.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.530
We can see that we have done well
to capture any patterns within

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.790
the time series.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.760
There is only a small amount of
correlation in the ACF at Lag 17,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.740
suggesting there may be room for
improvement but

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.410
attempting to correct such a small
correlation will not make much

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.150
difference in the forecasted results
