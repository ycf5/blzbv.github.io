00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.330
Now that we have a number of ways to
quantify how accurate our models are,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.580
how do we choose the best model?

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.203
Well, that may not always be easy.

00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:12.728
The most commonly used method would be
to use the model with the lowest AIC.

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:17.490
What happens if two models
have a very close AIC, or

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.070
what if we have used two
different model types?

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.130
That's when we can use our
Calculated Errors to take a deeper dive

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.940
into the available data presented
to us through our analysis.
