00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.080
In order to forecast the result from our
model, we need to specify confidence

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.020
intervals on which we want our model
to present in upper and lower bound for

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.410
the forecast.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.560
A confidence interval gives us
an interval within which we expect our

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.790
forecast to lie.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.490
For example, assuming the forecast
errors are in correlated and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.950
normally distributed then
a 95% confidence interval for

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.920
our forecast tells us that we
expect the actual results for

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.610
our forecast to fall within
the confidence interval 95% of the time.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.700
Our forecasting models will
not be able to predict exactly

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.940
what each future period will result in.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.840
This is why we set confidence
intervals to give us a feel for

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.340
where our data may fall
in forecasted periods.
