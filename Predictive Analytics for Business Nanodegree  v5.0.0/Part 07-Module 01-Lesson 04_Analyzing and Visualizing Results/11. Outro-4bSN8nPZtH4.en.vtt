Congrats.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.880
You've made it through our time
series forecasting course.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.910
We've been able to identify key
components of a time series,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.430
constructed forecasts with exponential
smoothing and ARIMA models, and

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.810
lastly we've interpreted and
visualized the results.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.420
I hope you've enjoyed our lessons.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.860
I know I have.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.590
Now, take the content we've learned and
start applying it to the real world.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.970
Happy forecasting, everybody.
