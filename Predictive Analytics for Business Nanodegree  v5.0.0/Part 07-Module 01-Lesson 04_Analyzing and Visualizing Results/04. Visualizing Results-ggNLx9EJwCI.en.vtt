00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.550
Once a model is selected based
upon the AIC and errors,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.720
we can use the time series forecasting
tool in Alteryx to produce

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.540
our forecast and visualization piece.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.190
Looking across all of our models,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.320
ARIMA and ETS, the ARIMA with
two MA terms is our best fit.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
It has the lowest AIC and the root
mean square error values are smallest.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.650
A lower RSMC means that our forecast
has a narrow range of possible values.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.153
The TS forecast tool provides
forecast for either an ARIMA or

00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:33.860
ETS model for
user specified number of future periods.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.730
In addition, upper and lower confidence
interval bounds are provided for

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.820
two different user-specified
percentage confidence intervals.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.790
For each confidence level, the expected
probability the true value will fall

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.440
within the provided bounds corresponds
to the confidence level percentage.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.157
The results from our O node in the TS
forecast tool provides a table that

00:00:54.157 --> 00:00:56.815
we could output to a number
of different file types

00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:03.157
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:06.904
The R node will present a TS
plot of the forecasted values

00:01:06.904 --> 00:01:09.069
in an image of the output table.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.510
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.352
Lastly, the interactive node
shows us the forecasted and

00:01:15.352 --> 00:01:18.790
actual values with the surrounding
confidence intervals.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.170
We can zoom further by
left-clicking on the plot and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.530
highlighting the area to zoom,
to better see the forecasted area.
