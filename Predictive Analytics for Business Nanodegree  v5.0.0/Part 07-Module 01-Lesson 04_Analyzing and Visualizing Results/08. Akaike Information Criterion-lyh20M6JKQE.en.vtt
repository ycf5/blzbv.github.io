00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.870
The Akaike Information Criterion is
a measure of the relative quality of

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.280
a statistical model.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.690
The calculation of AIC deals with the
tradeoff between the goodness of fit of

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.730
the model and
the complexity of the model.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.230
An AIC value of a single
model cannot tell us

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.180
any information regarding
the model's quality.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.950
It is used to compare many
different models produced

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.770
from the same time series.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.530
If all the candidate models fit poorly,
AIC will not give any warning of that.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.300
When comparing AIC values,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.130
the lowest value among the models
is considered the best fit.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.700
Let's open up our two workflows from
our ETS and Arema model construction.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.350
We'll start with the ETS model and
compare the results of the AIC values

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.150
for both model types we
used in the workflow.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.700
Looking at our results
of our ETS models,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.930
the non-dampened model had the lower
AIC, suggesting that moving forward,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.020
it will produce the best results.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.600
It also means,
based on this calculation,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.190
that the model was a better fit and
less complex than the dampened model.

00:00:58.488 --> 00:01:01.780
The Arema models show that the
additional MA term produced a slightly

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.580
better fit to our series.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.900
Going forward, we want to include
two MA terms for our forecast.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.350
With Altryx you can utilize an auto
model build algorithm that uses the AIC

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.600
to determine the best model.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.350
This means Altryx will set the terms for
your model, and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.930
choose the one with
the lowest AIC value.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.470
Neat?

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.450
To run an auto-produced model,
simply drag and drop an ARIMA or

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.860
ETS tool on the canvas, pick a model
name, set the target field and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.090
target field frequency,
then on the Other Options tab,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.580
select the number of periods
to include in the forecast.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.300
Now, click run.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.180
The ETS and
ARIMA tools are actually set to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.720
auto calculate the model
with the lowest AIC value
