00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.840
Your forecasting model should include
features which capture all the important

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.760
properties of the time series,
patterns of variation in level of trend,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.190
effects of seasonality and
removing autocorrelation.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.890
Moreover, the assumptions on which you
base your chosen model should agree with

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.600
your intuition about how the time series
is likely to behave in the future

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.340
when fitting a forecasting model.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.950
We can used a series of identifiers
that help us choose the best model.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.780
We'll compare criteria like
residual plots, forecasting errors,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.400
the Akaike information
criteria from our ETS and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.135
ARIMA models that we've constructed
from earlier lessons as our basis.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:38.475
How are we supposed to compare
forecast results against models,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.575
if the forecasts or
really just theoretical values?

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.635
Well that brings us to our next
lesson on holdout samples.
