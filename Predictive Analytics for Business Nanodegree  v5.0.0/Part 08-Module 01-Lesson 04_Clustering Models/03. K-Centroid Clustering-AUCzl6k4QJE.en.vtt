00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.580
The second primary method of clustering
is called the k-centroid method.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.027
It is called this because,
as opposed to the hierarchical method,

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:14.550
with this method you need to specify
the number of clusters you want in

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.170
the solution,
which is the k in k-centroids.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.679
The other difference is the methodology
is built around assigning an object

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:28.050
to the closest centroid, which is
essentially the center of the cluster.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.759
This centroid is repositioned
after each change to the clusters.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:38.817
This example is fairly basic with
just two variables, and dividing into

00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:43.893
two clusters, but it will help visualize
what occurs during the process.

00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:46.033
With the k-centroid process,

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:51.769
the initial positions of the centroids
is generally chosen at random.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.080
The objects to be clustered are then
assigned to the closest centroid.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:02.048
And then the centroid is
repositioned to become the new

00:01:02.048 --> 00:01:04.802
center of the formed cluster.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:05.876
With each step,

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:10.719
this reoccurs where the objects are
reassigned as needed to the centroid.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.733
And the centroid is then moved again,
until the reassignment and

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.599
centroid shift becomes negligible.
