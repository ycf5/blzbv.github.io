00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.500
In Alteryx, the building of
the cluster model is done using

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.669
the Case Centroid Cluster Analysis tool.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.879
First, we bring in the same data that
we used in the diagnostics process.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.240
Next, we bring in
the cluster analysis tool.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.730
The configuration looks
similar to what we saw in

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.170
the K-Centroids Diagnostics Tool,
with just a couple of minor changes.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.710
First, we'll give it a solution name.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.289
Next, we'll select
the same fields that we

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.310
used to determine the number of Clusters
we wanted from the Diagnostics tool.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.530
One important thing to understand,
is that we have determined the optimal

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.160
number of clusters based on
a certain set of variables and

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.500
a specific clustering method.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.820
So when we set up the process to
actually build out the clustering model,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.980
the configuration in this tool should
be the same as what was chosen

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:52.939
in the Diagnostics tool.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:56.019
To be specific,
select the same variables,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.410
the same standardization process and
the same method.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.299
When we decided what the optimal
number of clusters was,

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.495
we chose the Z score, and a neural gas.

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.995
As you can see,
I've selected the same items here.

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:15.204
Now we want to set the number of
clusters to be the number that we

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:18.701
decided in the diagnostics process,
to be optimal.

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.801
The only place where some
flexibility can occur is setting

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.672
the number of starting seeds.

00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.682
As you will recall, the initial
locations of the cluster centroids

00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:30.942
has an effect on
the outcome of the model.

00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:32.721
During the diagnostics process,

00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:37.001
we set it at a number that would give us
some variation, that would provide for

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.899
multiple results that
we could average from.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.359
When building the model out it is
usually best to increase this number as

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.629
it will provide for better accuracy as
the process runs through each iteration.

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:53.489
This will give it a better set of
results on which to base the final

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:54.649
solution.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.390
So as you'll recall during
the diagnostics process,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.159
the starting seeds was set at three.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.250
We're going to leave it with
the default here at ten.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.620
The results from the report
side of the process allow us to

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.730
understand the characteristics of
the clusters that were created.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:18.060
To see those, we would add a browse
tool to the report side of the tool.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.620
Now that the browse tool is added,
we just click Run.
