00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.400
As we go through the report results,
keep in mind that,

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.910
depending on your selections and
all of the configuration settings and

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.820
because the starting seeds are
randomized, the actual results may vary.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.660
What you should focus on
as we go through this

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.890
are the concepts in
interpreting the results.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.350
Let's open the results
up in a new window, so

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.650
they're more easily able to be seen.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.570
The first table shows
the results of the clusters.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.820
The cluster numbers themselves
are just arbitrary identifiers.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.609
The size column tells us how many
objects are in each of the clusters.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.149
If one of the clusters had
a really small number of objects

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.710
relative to the total number of objects,
that might indicate that the variables

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.009
related to those specific
objects are really unusual or

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:50.409
could be considered
outliers in themselves, and

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.439
you might want to look specifically
at why this is the case.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.479
The next column reports
the average distance.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.250
This represents the average distance
of each observation within the cluster

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.560
to the centroid of the cluster.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.609
When comparing clusters, the clusters
with the smallest average distance

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.989
are the most compact of the clusters,
and the ones with the higher average

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:17.729
are less compact and might show
more variability in the results.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.000
The maximum distance column shows
the distance of the observation that is

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.120
farthest from the centroid.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.079
Since this could be just a single
point with all the other points

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.799
relatively close to the centroid, this
isn't of much use other than to show

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.230
how far out the farthest outlier is.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.010
Separation shows the distance
of the closest point

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.570
not in the relevant cluster.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.489
So here, the larger the number,
the more separation there is between

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:52.109
that cluster and all of the other
clusters and the better for the model.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.629
The chart with the individual variables
showing can best be used a way to

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:58.849
characterize each cluster.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.939
To do this, it is best to use
it within variable comparisons.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.969
In other words,
you don't look across horizontally but

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.210
compare the cluster results only for
a specific variable.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.110
So that when you look at the numbers
represented within the same variable,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.920
a high positive versus a high
negative would indicate that for

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.699
that variable, those two clusters
are opposite of each other.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:29.739
For example, if you look within
the Snow variable for PC1,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.960
cluster 6, with the largest
positive value, and cluster 7,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.790
with the largest negative value, are
the extreme clusters related to snow,

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:44.549
one with potentially lots of snowfall
and the other with little snowfall.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.200
Now, keep in mind as you interpret
these numbers that the positive and

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:54.329
negatives indications don't necessarily
correlate with most snow and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.240
least snow respectively but
just that they are the most different.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.370
In other words, in this example,
the most snow could actually have

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.780
a negative indicator, and the least
snow could have a positive indicator.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.590
We'll be able to determine that when
we start validating the results.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.770
For example, I've seen cluster
solutions where there were only four or

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.930
five stores in a cluster.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.580
When looking at these
store characteristics,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.870
they were stores that were
intentionally configured differently

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.170
from an operational standpoint.

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.859
We actually ended up excluding those
stores from the cluster analysis

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.400
entirely, and this then created
a better clustering solution for

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.319
the remaining stores.
