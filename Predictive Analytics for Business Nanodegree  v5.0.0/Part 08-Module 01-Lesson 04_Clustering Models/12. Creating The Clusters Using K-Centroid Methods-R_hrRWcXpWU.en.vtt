00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.339
Now that we've gone through the process
of determining the optimal number of

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.929
clusters, given the data we're using,
with most software it's just a matter of

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.269
configuring the process to build out
a model that reflects that number.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.179
With Alteryx, it is relatively easy
to continue on with this process.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.750
Let's take a look at how that works.
