00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.810
The hierarchical method can be
divided into two approaches.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.929
The first approach,
called the agglomerative or

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:10.589
bottom up approach,
is simpler and more popular.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.620
It starts a process with each
object in its own cluster and

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.458
with each step it will merge
the two most similar clusters.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.699
This is done through
a concept known as linkage.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.599
There are different methods
available for using linkage and

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.950
determining the most similar clusters.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.479
The primary linkage methods are single,
complete, average, and centroid linkage.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.910
Single linkage basically measures
the distance between the closest pair of

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.399
points.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.539
Complete linkage measures the distance
between the farthest pair of points.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.700
Average linkage measures the average
distance between all of the points.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.600
And lastly, centroid linkage
measures the distance between

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.539
the cluster centroids, or center points.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.670
This last one is the easiest
to implement and explain, so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.409
it is most popular in
fields like biology.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.400
Now the hierarchical process stops

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.109
when all of the objects
are aggregated into a single cluster.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.100
The second hierarchical approach is
the divisive or top down approach.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:25.890
It starts the process with all of
the objects in a single cluster, and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.299
then removes the outsiders from
the least cohesive cluster.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.370
This process stops when each
object is in its own cluster.

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.049
With both of these approaches,
one thing to notice

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.489
is that you don't have to predetermine
how many clusters there should be.

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:46.780
The process basically builds out
the structure of the hierarchy and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.310
then you can decide how many clusters
work for a good clustering solution.
