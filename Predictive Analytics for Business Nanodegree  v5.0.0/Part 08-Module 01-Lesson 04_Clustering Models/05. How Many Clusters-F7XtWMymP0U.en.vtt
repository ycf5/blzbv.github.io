00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.169
Now that we know a little bit
about how clustering works,

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.320
another step in the process to
providing a good clustering solution

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.089
is to figure out how many
clusters we should have.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.079
The number of clusters you choose will
depend on heavily on the objective of

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.850
the clustering and
the business constraints.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.205
When I was a consultant working on a
store clustering project, our client was

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:28.834
working with a product allocation system
that would only allow for eight groups.

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:33.246
So, that's what we used as the maximum
for our target number of clusters.

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:37.457
The unfortunate thing with a situation
like that is that the best clustering

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:40.551
solution for
their store configuration could actually

00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:44.649
have been higher than that, but
their systems just couldn't handle it.
