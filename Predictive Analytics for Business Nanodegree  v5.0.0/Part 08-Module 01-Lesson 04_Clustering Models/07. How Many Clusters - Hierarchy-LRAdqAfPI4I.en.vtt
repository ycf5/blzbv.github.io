00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.219
Now, at the hierarchical clustering
process, as we have seen,

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.199
we end up with a dendrogram
that provides for

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.910
a way to visually determine where
to cut off the number of clusters.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.160
Here we see a dendrogram fit as a result
of hierarchical clustering process.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.432
In this case, we could have drawn a line
at this point which would've determined

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:27.800
that there would be 3 clusters created,
as we can see from the different colors.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:33.920
Or, we could have drawn the line
here and ended up with 4 clusters.

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.320
But, we also would've ended up with
a cluster with a relatively small number

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.070
of objects.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.969
As you can see, the number of
branches that the line crosses

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.939
indicates the number of clusters.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.280
Here, we end up with 6 clusters.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:54.359
And here,

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.500
we end up with 11 which in reality may
end up being too many to work with.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.829
And, ends up with some large clusters
and some very small clusters.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.710
Again, setting the number
becomes a bit subjective and

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.573
really depends on the business
problem you were trying to solve.

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:18.237
Also, as we commented earlier, the
hierarchical method will begin to get

00:01:18.237 --> 00:01:22.948
a bit more difficult to work with when
dealing with large data sets of objects.

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:25.268
