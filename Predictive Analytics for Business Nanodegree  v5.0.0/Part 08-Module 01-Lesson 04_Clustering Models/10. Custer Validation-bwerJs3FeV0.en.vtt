00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.290
Now the two indices that Alteryx
produces, the Adjusted Rand Index and

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.679
the C-H Index are calculated for
each of those solutions and

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.800
then combined to form its own dataset.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.469
The means, medians,
minimums and maximums and

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:21.219
interquartile ranges are all calculated,
so that we can get a sense for

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:26.879
how good the cluster solution is for
each number of clusters that is tested.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.000
Alteryx then provides
a visualization of this data

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.429
that is typically a good way
to evaluate the results.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:38.969
To see the visualizations in Alteryx,
you just need to add a browse tool

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.560
to the cluster diagnostics tool and
click run.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.400
Keep in mind that depending on
which clustering method you choose,

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.530
the time it takes to go through
this process, because there are so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.950
many iterations, can vary considerably.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.318
On these charts, along the y-axis
is the value of the index.

00:00:57.317 --> 00:01:01.989
And the x-axis is
the number of the clusters.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.120
For each cluster number, it displays a
box and whisker plot of the index value.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.960
With the black line
representing the median, and

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:15.949
the blue area representing the area
between the first and third quartile.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.150
The whiskers show how far
out some of the values are.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.090
For the AR Index, the higher the index,
the better the stability of the cluster.

00:01:26.168 --> 00:01:29.520
For the C-H Index, the higher the index,

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:34.209
the better the distinctness and
compactness of the clusters.

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:38.819
So what we are looking for is where
the median of the index is high and

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.489
the spread of the various
iterations is minimized.

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:48.228
In other words the minimum and maximum
and interquartile range is compact.

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:53.420
In this instance, using the K-Means
method, the Adjusted Rand Index

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.719
might indicate that clusters
number 6 and 7 could be good.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.329
With 7 having a little higher median but

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.840
with a bit more spread of
the interquartile range.

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.319
The C-H Index indicates clusters
number 9 through 12 might work,

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.349
with probably 10 being
the best solution,

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.219
with that having the highest median and
a fairly compact spread.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.430
These results aren't
all that conclusive.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.659
So the next step would be
to run the same diagnostics

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.079
using the two other methods available.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.310
The K-Median and Neural Gas methods and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.650
compare those results to see if
there's a standout kind of solution.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.569
Keep in mind that when
comparing methods,

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.189
you need to pay attention to
the scale of the index results.

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.346
In this case, the C-H Index
ranges from about 4,000 to 5,700.

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:51.330
When comparing,
the boxplots might look the same but

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.418
could be relatively higher or
lower than another method.

00:02:55.418 --> 00:02:58.210
Also, this could be where
you begin to reconsider

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.969
the variables that you are using
in your clustering process.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:06.030
With our example, it pretty much
revolves around the actual climate

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.729
metrics, so we won't worry about that.

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:10.399
But with other business cases,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.510
such as segmenting a population
of customers, you begin to have

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:20.030
much more flexibility around what you
want to use to determine your clusters.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.509
Again, as a reminder, the type of data
that you use will be dependent on

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.389
the objective of your segmentation.

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.419
Regardless of
the clustering methodology,

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.009
building a clustering model should
be considered an iterative process

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:40.519
where you need to determine how many and
which variables provide the best model,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.990
as well as how many clusters
provide the best model as well.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.189
So a typical process is to run some
initial cluster models, attempt to

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:55.699
validate the results with what is known
both with internal validation methods,

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:01.969
using indices, as well as with external
validation, which we will cover later.

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.449
And then we run the modelling process

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.979
with differing variables to see
if improvements can be made.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.259
Also as I mentioned,

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.780
each software package will
use their own set of indices.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.800
The key here is to make
sure that you understand

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.259
what the specific index is measuring and
the appropriate way to evaluate it.
