00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.650
Now that the cluster model is actually
created, the next part is just to use it

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.089
to assign objects with
a cluster identifier.

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:13.140
In Alteryx it is as easy as adding
an Append Cluster tool to the workflow

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.780
from the object side of
the Cluster Analysis tool.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.560
And then connecting
in the original data.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.410
We can add a Select tool
to the end of the workflow

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.769
before an Output tool to just
output the Store ID and Cluster ID.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.570
Now that we have those
two fields selected,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.980
we would drop in an Output Data tool.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:37.279
And you would save this to a file that
you would then combine with your raw

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.120
data for further validation.
