00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.570
In this lesson, you were introduced
to the two primary methods for

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.140
creating clusters.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.779
The hierarchical method and
the K-centroids method.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.299
And you can now determine which of
these methods might work best for

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.899
your clustering solution depending
on the data and its objective.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.679
We also reviewed the issues and

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.530
subjectiveness around choosing
the best number of clusters.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.859
And you can now perform the diagnostics
around K-centroid clustering and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.097
interpret two indices that can
help you make that choice.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:36.649
And once you decided how
many clusters you want,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.359
you can now process the data and
assign objects to specific clusters.
