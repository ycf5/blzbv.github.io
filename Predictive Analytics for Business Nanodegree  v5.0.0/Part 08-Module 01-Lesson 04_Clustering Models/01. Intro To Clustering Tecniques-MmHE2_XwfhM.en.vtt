00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.399
Now that we have our Data Prep to be
used in a Clustering Process, and

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.000
we have an idea of which Variables and
Principle Components we might want to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.719
incorporate, it's time to start looking
at the actual clustering process itself.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.730
That's what we'll focus on
throughout this lesson.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.629
Now, there are at least a few different
methods that have been developed in

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:24.910
recent years, that will divide a number
of objects into relatively homogeneous,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.589
or similar segments or clusters.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.809
They primarily fall into
two types of methods.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.210
One is called a Hierarchical method, and
the other is called a K-Centroid method.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.770
I will go over the high level
characteristics of both of these,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.000
as well as some of the differences.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.359
Later in the lesson, we will look in
detail at the K-Centroid method, for

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:47.579
our hands on exercise.
