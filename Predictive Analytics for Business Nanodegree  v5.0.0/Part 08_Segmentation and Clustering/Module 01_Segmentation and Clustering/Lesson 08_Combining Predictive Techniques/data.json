Once you complete all three tasks, please submit the project as a PDF. \n\n### Tips\n\n* **Split up your Alteryx workflows:** You will be using multiple data sources and complex tools, which can slow down the workflow runtime. Splitting up the workflows makes the process more manageable.\n\n* **Map out your work:** Before you dive into your analysis, think about the steps and plan ahead. This will reduce the amount of unnecessary work.\n\n* **Use visualizations:** Include visualizations to help explain your decisions and communicate your findings. Remember what you learned about making them look great!\n\n* **Ask for help:** Mentors and your fellow students can help you if you get stuck on something. When  posting a question, make sure you include enough specificity so others can help.\n\n",

The terms \"formats\" and \"segments\" will be used interchangeably throughout this project.

What is the optimal number of store formats? How did you arrive at that number?\n2. How many stores fall into each store format?\n3. Based on the results of the clustering model, what is one way that the clusters differ from one another?\n4.
