00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.939
What most clustering algorithms try
to do is to assign the objects into

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.370
clusters that are similar to the other
objects in the same cluster.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.740
And the way the algorithms typically do
this is using the concept of distance.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.850
As we go through these lessons,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.230
think of the term distance as a way
to quantify or measure similarity.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.160
The clustering algorithms try to create
segments so that the objects within

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.990
each segment are as similar or
close to each other as possible.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.320
At the same time, they make it so the
segments themselves are as dissimilar,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.610
or far away,
from each other as possible.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.520
So the best cluster solutions involve
clusters that have the tightest

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.720
individual cluster cohesion, and the
greatest distinct cluster separation.
