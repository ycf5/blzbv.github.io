00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Hi, I'm Rod Light,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.735
I'm a senior Solutions Engineer and Practice Lead for Alteryx,

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:08.460
the leader in self-service data analytics.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.220
In this course, I will be showing you the concepts and

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.610
practices related to segmentation and clustering.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.100
Many times, as a business analyst,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.500
you may be asked to provide answers for

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.365
specific entities in the business such as stores or customers.

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:29.550
This can turn into an insurmountable task purely because of the size of the business.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.865
For example, a retail business can have hundreds or even thousands of stores.

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:37.190
Creating models to determine what is

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.475
the best product mix in each of these could be daunting.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:43.410
Another example can be related to marketing.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.840
It would be great if you could send out flyers or emails individually to each of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.670
your customers that are customized considering each customer's needs or interests,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.050
but having thousands or millions of customers can make this next to impossible.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.580
Because it's much easier to make decisions when working with

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.269
a smaller set of entities rather than have to work with a larger one,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.390
one approach to deal with this kind of problem is by

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.020
dividing the entities into smaller set of objects called segments.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.970
In this lesson, we will cover some general concepts around

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.650
segmenting and a technique used to create the segments called clustering.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.290
I will show the difference between clustering and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.160
grouping which is what many businesses do.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.240
We will cover at a high level the concepts used to create the clusters and I will give

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.800
a few examples of how clustering is used in different industries. Let's get started.
