00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
In statistics, there are methods known as supervised and unsupervised learning methods.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.710
You might remember learning

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.999
various predictive methods such as linear or logistic regression.

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.015
These modeling methods are based on using a set of

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:20.045
predictor variables to build a model that will predict a target variable.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:24.345
In statistical vernacular, this is called supervised learning,

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.675
where the modeling process learns from the target

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:31.580
or dependent variable as it creates the model.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.695
Unsupervised learning is a little different,

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:36.955
and clustering is an example of this.

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:39.470
With unsupervised learning, there is

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.475
no target variable that is used in creating the model.

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.790
With this method, the clustering algorithm used

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.440
learns from the multiple variables supplied in the data.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.425
It then groups the objects without being told the logic by which to do it.

00:00:55.425 --> 00:01:00.825
After this process, it ends up creating a new variable known as the cluster number.

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:04.090
Since clustering groups objects in this way,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.330
it is referred to as an unsupervised learning model.
