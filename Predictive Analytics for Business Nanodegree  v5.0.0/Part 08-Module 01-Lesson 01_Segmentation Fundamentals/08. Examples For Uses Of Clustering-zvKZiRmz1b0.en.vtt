00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.340
Now that you have a good
overview of segmentation and

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.910
clustering, our next lesson will begin
to dive in to some of the details of

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.910
building out a clustering process.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.970
Before we do that though, I thought I
would share a few real world examples

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.999
where clustering is being used
across various industries.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.760
Now since my background revolves
around the retail industry, and

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.910
many use cases for clustering involve
store and customer segmentation.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.990
The actual exercises we will be
going through, during the class,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.520
will center in this area.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.050
However, clustering can, and is being
used across a number of industries.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.880
As we've discussed, clustering is
really about creating a balance between

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.670
standardization and localization.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.730
Whenever you need to work with objects,
but

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.290
have too many to make sense of,
clustering can achieve this balance, and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.025
help make working with these
objects more effective.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.010
Let's take a quick look at some examples
to get you thinking of how to apply

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.350
these concepts,
in whatever area you work in.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.750
One example,
relates to the insurance industry.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.810
In the instructor notes,
there's a link to a paper that explains

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.320
how they're using clustering techniques
to identify fraudulent insurance claims.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.240
Variables such as
beneficiary payment size.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.180
Interest payment size, and
timing between claim submission and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.420
payment, are used to cluster the claims.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.263
Since most claims should fall into the
norm, those clusters that have a small

00:01:34.263 --> 00:01:37.916
population are identified as
potential fraud suspects,

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:40.464
and they're checked more thoroughly.

00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:42.385
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:45.880
Here's another example that's
a little more fun to think about.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.400
It relates to how a company
might make use of segmentation,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.590
in order to direct their marketing
efforts most effectively.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.490
I'm not sure how they
created these clusters, but

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.580
it's a great example of how a market
can be segmented in a way, so

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.100
that the business decision makers can
understand who they are marketing to.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.758
They decided to somehow
segment the audience for

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:12.870
the 2016 NBA Championship Series.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.120
As you can see, they broke it down
into segments like rap and hip-hop,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.360
teen girls, and ballers.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.930
And then they took those segments, and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.540
used Twitter comments to determine who
the specific segments were rooting for.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.350
While there were obvious choices,
#DUBNATION for

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.090
the Warriors, and
#AllIn216 for the Cavaliers,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.120
it seems that the Teen Girls might
have a thing for Steph Curry.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.259
But the rappers,
may slightly favor a LeBron connection.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.590
The point here,
is that with this information,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.820
better decisions might be made on where
to spend marketing dollars depending,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.820
of course,
on what someone in trying to sell.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.600
Another example I thought I'd mention,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.280
just to show that clustering methods are
not only used in the business world, but

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.509
can also be found in many
scientific disciplines.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.840
In this case ,clustering was
used in a bioinformatics study,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.450
to analyze patterns of
anti-microbial resistance,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.685
against various food borne outbreaks,
such as salmonella and e-coli.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.950
One final example relates to how
clustering is now being explored in

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.840
the field of education.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.500
This paper,
linked to the instructor notes,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.590
describes how clustering can be used
to investigate similarities, and

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.380
differences between groups
of school sites, or for

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.910
clustering students, or even clustering
on student behavior patterns.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.450
Now before you click on the links,
be forewarned that these kind of studies

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.209
are typically communicated
with academic papers.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.610
I'm not suggesting that you
read through any of these,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.450
unless it's of specific interest to you.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.240
Again, the point of these examples is
to show how clustering methods can

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.600
simplify how we deal with
a large number of objects,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.480
by segmenting them into
statistically similar groups.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.820
It's not just restricted
to a specific industry.
