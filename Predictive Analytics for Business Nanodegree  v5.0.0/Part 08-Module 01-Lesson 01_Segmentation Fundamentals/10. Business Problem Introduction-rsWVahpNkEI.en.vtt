00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
We now understand a little bit more about what segmentation and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.175
clustering are and why we might want to do this kind of analysis.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.740
Let's start looking into the details of what you

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.675
need to do to perform a cluster analysis.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:18.870
For this course, we'll use a hands on business case that will let you explore and

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.640
practice the concepts typically found in a clustering segmentation process.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.880
The business problem is that a retail company sells outdoor furniture,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.355
recreational equipment, and garden supplies in all of its stores.

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:40.040
The company has over 2,000 stores across the continental United States and wants to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.910
ensure that it places the various product items in the stores at the appropriate time,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.120
considering the weather seasons.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.950
As we've mentioned in our Lowe's example earlier in this lesson,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.660
this business wants to place

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.350
barbecue grills in their stores where the consumers will be interested in

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.410
barbecuing and want to place the garden items in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.650
their stores when people will be interested in planting those items.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.290
In other words, they don't want to put grills on sale in

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.590
areas when it's snowing and no one is barbecuing,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.145
nor do they want to ship daisies when snow is on the ground either.

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:21.355
Now, they could create individual seasonality plans for each of the 2,000 plus stores,

00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:24.870
but it would cost way too much to put this into effect.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.100
They have asked us to create segments that will

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.190
allow them to create plans for those segments,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.675
that can then be applied to each store in each segment.

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:38.450
This should give them maximum operating efficiency and yet

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.550
provide for the best scenarios to have maximum revenues.
