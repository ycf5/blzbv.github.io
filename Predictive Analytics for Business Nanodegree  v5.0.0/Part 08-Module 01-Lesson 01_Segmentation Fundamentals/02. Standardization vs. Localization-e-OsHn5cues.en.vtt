00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
Let's think about the two business cases I mentioned earlier.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.445
In each, there's a tension between the two extremes.

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:10.470
On one end, you want to deal with the group as a whole.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.880
This is known as standardization and it's

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.695
usually the cheapest and most efficient approach.

00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:19.910
It's where you basically treat all of the objects in the same way.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.385
But, you'll generally get better results dealing with each entity individually.

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:28.420
This alternative approach is commonly known as localization

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.050
and allows you to customize based on specifics of the individual.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.910
With standardization, we can treat all stores the same.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.735
We can send them the same set of products to put on the shelves,

00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:42.805
to all sell at the same time.

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:48.090
This is good for the business because it simplifies logistics and supply chain planning,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.185
saving on costs, and making the process efficient.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.640
However, this might be bad for the business because

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.790
each store's market could be different and the stores may

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.160
end up with overstocked items that never

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.410
sell or run out of items where they could have sold more.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.820
As an example, think about how a home improvement retail chain,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.490
like Lowe's, stocks barbecue grills in their stores.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.520
If they were to send the grills to all of their stores

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.700
across the country at the same time, say in March,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.240
they might get quite different results for their stores in Texas,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.970
where the weather might be nice,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.680
as compared to the stores in North Dakota,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.750
where it could be still snowing.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.445
On the other hand, with localization,

00:01:32.445 --> 00:01:35.180
we can treat all stores differently with

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.295
their own product mix that works for that specific store.

00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:43.265
This is good for the business because we're able to meet the local needs

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:47.475
of each specific market and optimize the results of the store,

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:50.960
but it's bad for the business because it creates a huge amount of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.855
extra costs and a lot more resources are needed to accomplish it.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:58.280
Let's think about Lowe's again,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.475
they have almost 2,000 stores in the US.

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:04.040
If they tried to set the number and timing of

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.860
those same grills for each individual store,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.470
their distribution costs would go way up and

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.240
their product and logistic teams would probably go crazy with all of the extra detail.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.170
So, really in the long run,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.790
neither option is good for

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.680
business and that's where segmentation and clustering can help,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.370
by capturing the efficiencies of the standardization and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.660
the benefits of customization that localization provides.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.300
When you break up your larger group into a set of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.630
smaller segments based on a set of characteristics,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.640
then you can expect that the objects and each segment will behave in a similar manner.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.095
This allows for a balance between the two extremes of standardizing and localizing,

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:50.180
which makes operations much more scalable and manageable.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.625
Looking back at our Lowe's example one last time,

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.895
if they divide their stores and to say

00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:59.835
a dozen segments that have similar seasonality characteristics,

00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:02.585
it makes it much easier to ship the grills to

00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:06.195
all the stores in a given segment at the same time.

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:09.530
But, the other positive is that they can start selling grills in

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.710
the regions where customers will buy them earlier in the year.
