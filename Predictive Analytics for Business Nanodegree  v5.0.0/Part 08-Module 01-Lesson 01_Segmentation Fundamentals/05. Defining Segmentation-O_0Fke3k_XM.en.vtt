00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.750
Let's take some time to better
understand segmentation, and

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.130
the statistical
methodology of clustering.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.990
You can find a variety of nuances
in the definitions of these terms.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.940
But throughout this class,
we will be considering them,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.539
basically as interchangeable.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.930
Clustering is a statistical methodology
that groups similar objects into

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.160
clusters.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.940
In business,
these are often referred to as segments.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.280
So, clustering is what we're doing
from the statistical perspective, and

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.970
creating segments, or

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.400
segmentation is what we're doing
from the business perspective.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.450
Here's a more technical
definition of clustering.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.420
It's a mathematical procedure for
multidimensional analysis.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.530
Given the characteristics
of a set of objects,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.560
this procedure groups similar
objects into clusters.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.170
The resulting individual groups, contain
the objects that are most similar

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.009
to each other, when compared to
those outside of their group.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.730
I understand that that's
not exactly simple.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.130
And it's not necessary to
grasp all that is there.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.892
What's really important to understand
at this point in the class,

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:14.390
is that clustering, and
the resulting clusters or segments,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.698
is not just a process of sorting and
grouping, or binning.

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:20.318
It is based on
a statistical methodology,

00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:23.460
that can be applied to
a large number of variables.
