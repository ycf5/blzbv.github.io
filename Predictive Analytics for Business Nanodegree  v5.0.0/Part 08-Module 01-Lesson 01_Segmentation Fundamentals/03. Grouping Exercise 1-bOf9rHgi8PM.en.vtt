00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.650
Let's practice a little with
what we've covered so far.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.109
We've provided a small dataset
labeled stores.csv that

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.950
represents ten stores with
the dollar amount of sales.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.445
Management would like to segment the
stores to set up a benchmarking system

00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:19.425
so that the performance
of each store's evaluated

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.965
in relation to the performance of the
stores within their respective groups.

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:28.565
Divide the list of stores into what you
would consider the three best segments.
