00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.315
You already can do a ton with Tableau to explore dataset.

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:07.600
The ideas in this lesson will help you with tackling a dataset for

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.080
the first time and putting your final products together.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.109
There are five purposes of this lesson before you move on to

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:18.189
your project and complete your Tableau journey here at Udacity.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.284
We've been working with a single dataset,

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:23.859
but it's important that you feel comfortable with lots of different types of data.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.035
So you will gain practice with that in this lesson.

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.094
You will learn about dashboards,

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:31.750
which allow you to analyze multiple sheets all at

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.730
the same time and even build filters that act over all of the sheets at once.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:42.734
You will combine items one and two above to create dashboards for some new datasets.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:46.100
Don't worry, we'll do this together to build your confidence.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.760
That way you get some practice before you tackle the project.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:51.384
You will learn about Stories,

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.059
a feature of Tableau that allows you to link together your worksheets and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.280
dashboards to give an audience a well-rounded grasp of your insights.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.340
Finally, we will point you some additional resources

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.159
for you to continue learning and keep your Tableau skills fresh.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.019
You will be using a few new datasets to complete the questions in this lesson.

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:13.959
So they'll be provided in the Resources tab.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:18.369
A breakdown of the main topics covered in this section are provided below.
