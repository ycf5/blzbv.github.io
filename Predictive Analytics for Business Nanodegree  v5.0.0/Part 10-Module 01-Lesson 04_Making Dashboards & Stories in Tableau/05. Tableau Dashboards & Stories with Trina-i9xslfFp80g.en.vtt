00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
hi welcome back so now I'm interested in

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.210
how you as a tablet professional

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.710
actually start exploring a dataset yeah

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.540
that's a great question and the fun

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.179
thing about tableau is that there are a

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.739
million and one ways to explore data you

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.679
can start with a question that you have

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:21.750
and then try to answer that question in

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.850
the data or you can start just by

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.579
looking at the dimensions and measures

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.890
that you have and dragging those out

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.139
onto the canvas and changing things

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.899
around and changing the aggregation and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.880
starting to explore and everyone has a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.579
different process you can invent your

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.290
own process I often invent new processes

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.509
but one of the first things that I

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.100
usually do is I take a look at the data

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.960
that I'm working with because often it

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.899
wasn't data that i personally collected

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.719
in this case I've brought a data set

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.000
that the UN collected on refugee data so

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.399
we're looking at asylum seekers where

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.219
they came from where they ended up when

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.879
they when they ended up in those

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.618
countries and I've already taken a step

00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:06.269
to clean up the data often that's a

00:01:04.618 --> 00:01:08.099
necessary step before you start

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:09.929
visualizing it and in this case it was

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:11.789
really easy i just check this checkbox

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.860
to clean it with our data interpreter

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.780
and that took away a few rows in the

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:18.719
beginning that work related to the rest

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.189
of the data set so then i'm going to

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.780
open up a sheet and i'm going to start

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:24.419
asking questions so one of the things i

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.070
want to know is what how many people are

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.290
in this data set right how many people

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.919
are we talking about here so i'm going

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.659
to drag this over onto the canvas and i

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.969
can see that we're talking about a bit

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.219
over eight million asylum-seekers

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.259
ok so that's interesting now I want to

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:44.849
know where did these people come from

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.399
and so i'm going to drag their origin

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:50.188
onto the columns

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.228
now this is a little bit difficult for

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:54.839
me to see it would be helpful if i could

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:56.819
rotate it so i'm going to swap the axes

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.909
here and then I'm going to sort the data

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.228
and now I can start to see a story and I

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.210
can start to see where these

00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:07.109
asylum-seekers originated

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.899
yeah it's interesting so now that this

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.879
point how would you say that use filters

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.919
to keep digging into the day

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.710
yeah that's a great question so tableau

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.899
makes it really easy to narrow down your

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.700
data and drill in and understand the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.180
data from different perspectives so in

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:26.069
this case for example I have a date that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.950
might be interesting to explore so i'm

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.650
going to show a filter for the date and

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:34.469
then instead of checkboxes I want to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.200
have a single value list and now I can

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:40.289
start to see trends and ask questions

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:43.709
for example the data in 1999 looks

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:46.259
different than the data in 2008 and so

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.420
now I can start to say huh what was it

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:51.929
that caused those changes and what can I

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:53.849
learn from this data set right so now

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.980
that you know where you know diving

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.960
deeper with the the filters and all that

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:59.879
how would you actually start making this

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.469
into a dashboard so that you can like

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.430
share this interesting stories with

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.719
others

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.730
yeah so dashboard is a series of parts

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.859
that when combined are greater than the

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:13.319
whole right so a number of

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.900
visualizations that could be combined to

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.789
tell a different story or show you a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.780
different perspective of your data so

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:23.639
here i have a bar chart but this is

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.919
geographic data so it might also be

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.289
interesting to look at it as a map so

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.329
here i have a dimension that shows the

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.459
country and i'm going to click on a

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.750
little show me section in the corner

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.580
here that's going to suggest some

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.599
visualizations and here it selected a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:44.189
map so if I add this map it is now

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:46.680
showing me where asylum-seekers ended up

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:49.139
all of the countries that took in asylum

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.080
seekers are represented by a single .

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:55.589
but i also want to know how many

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.570
asylum-seekers went to each country so i

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.250
might take this number of asylum seekers

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:05.189
and drag this on to color and now we can

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.840
start to see where there are some hot

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.879
spots so it looks like Germany as a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.640
hotspot and actually all of Europe looks

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:15.150
kind of interesting so i'm going to zoom

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:19.500
in on Europe and now I can start to see

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.689
a geographic story emerged now there's

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.899
also a time dimension in this data set

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:26.240
that's interesting to explore

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:30.198
and so one of the things that I could do

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.490
is I could look at the number of asylum

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.930
seekers and then I could look at the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.269
date

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.129
ok and see tableau automatically change

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:41.959
that into a line chart for me because

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.959
the line is a really good way to explore

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:47.418
dates and now this date actually also

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:50.508
comes with a built-in hierarchy and what

00:04:47.418 --> 00:04:53.029
that means is i can i see a plus button

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:56.840
here and that means that i can drill

00:04:53.029 --> 00:05:01.099
down further to quarter or two for

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:04.849
example a month and I can start to see

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.260
the data in different ways and from

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.419
different perspectives

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.819
now if I wanted to turn this into a

00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:13.579
dashboard I would tap on the new

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:17.180
dashboard icon here and here i have

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:19.490
sheets that are in the corner for me and

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.439
I can start dragging those onto my

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.759
dashboard and if i hover over them i see

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.050
a little thumbnail that helps me know

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.120
what I'm looking at

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.418
so I'm going to drag that sheet here i'm

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.500
going to drag the map out on top and

00:05:29.418 --> 00:05:36.319
then i'm going to drag this line chart

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.120
to the side now i can't quite see

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.639
everything that's going on so i'm going

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.280
to change this for fixed size to

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.720
automatic and then there are a couple of

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:46.728
things that I want to do here i want to

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.039
take away these titles they're not

00:05:46.728 --> 00:05:55.459
really helping me right now so we'll

00:05:52.038 --> 00:05:57.860
remove those and then we'll remove this

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:59.388
and then I want to one of the other cool

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.310
things that you can do with tableau is

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.079
that you can use visualization as

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.310
filters so that's another really

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:06.469
interesting thing that you can do with

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.259
filters so here we have filters for

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.750
dates but we can also filter by country

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:16.759
so what i can do is i can click on this

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:22.158
button to use as a filter and then i can

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:26.089
take this filter for date and I can

00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:28.728
apply to all of the worksheets using

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:31.399
this data source

00:06:28.728 --> 00:06:33.740
ok and then i'm going to do a simple

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:36.688
customization here i'm also going to

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.110
float

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:45.569
this i'm going to change it to a

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:48.989
drop-down and then i will resize it will

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.519
put it on the map here and i'll take

00:06:48.988 --> 00:06:55.109
this away

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:58.110
ok and now we have a visualization and

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.569
if i put that into full-screen mode you

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.419
have this beautiful view where you can

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:05.848
start to explore data right so now i can

00:07:03.418 --> 00:07:11.758
see what's happening in france in $MONTH

00:07:05.848 --> 00:07:14.098
2008 vs 2014 for example right and you

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:17.009
can start really digging in and asking

00:07:14.098 --> 00:07:21.329
questions and exploring a very rich way

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:24.869
great that's really cool like that

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:27.360
ok so these are dashboards but tableau

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:29.669
also lets you build stories right so

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.259
what's the difference between a story

00:07:29.668 --> 00:07:33.359
and a dashboard and when would you use

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:35.069
one rather than the other

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.379
yeah that's a great question and I like

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:39.989
to think of it as a story has a

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:42.088
narrative and it has a sequence you want

00:07:39.988 --> 00:07:43.438
people to understand the information in

00:07:42.088 --> 00:07:45.689
a particular order

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:47.669
so with a dashboard it gives you an

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:49.169
overview of what's going on so I think

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:50.639
of it kind of like you know you show up

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:52.649
at the food truck and there's the menu

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.778
on the side and you want a picture of

00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:56.158
what all the different options are and

00:07:54.778 --> 00:07:57.959
maybe you're only interested in

00:07:56.158 --> 00:07:59.459
appetizers right now it's really easy

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:02.699
for you to find that appetizer section

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:04.738
and just get something small a story on

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:06.598
the other hand is more like a comic book

00:08:04.738 --> 00:08:09.508
you really want to understand the

00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:12.748
history and context and understand how

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:15.419
you came to a particular conclusion so

00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:18.059
you can also build stories and tableau

00:08:15.418 --> 00:08:19.889
so i'm going to click on the new story

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:22.349
button and maybe I want to tell the

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:25.079
story of how I arrived at a particular

00:08:22.348 --> 00:08:27.118
insight so here I can take the sheets

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:30.629
and dashboards and combine them into

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:33.538
stories so maybe I start with this sheet

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:40.918
and i add it here and i add a caption

00:08:33.538 --> 00:08:44.098
this is the first part of my story and

00:08:40.918 --> 00:08:48.829
then I can take another sheet and i can

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:56.780
add a new story . and add a caption

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:59.720
here's where i found this insight and

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:01.939
you can also add dashboards as well

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.360
right and in this case we're also going

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:08.420
to move this changes to automatic so i

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:13.009
