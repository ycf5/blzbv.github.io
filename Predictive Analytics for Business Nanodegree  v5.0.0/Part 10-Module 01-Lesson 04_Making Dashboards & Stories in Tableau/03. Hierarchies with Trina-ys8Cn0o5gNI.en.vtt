Hi, welcome back.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.670
So Tableau is really good at grouping
data together and letting you kind

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.620
of drill down into these groups,
in what they call hierarchies, right?

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.687
So could you show us an example of
some hierarchies you've used and

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:17.220
data you've looked at?

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.493
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and actually I have
a really great example for

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:20.638
hierarchies right here.

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:24.580
I have a dataset that has
the top grossing movies and

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.732
you can see those movies by director,
by genre, by a number of different ways.

00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:37.980
And so I'm curious about the genre and
actually the profits by genre.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.620
So here I'm looking at
the profits by genre and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.180
I'm seeing that the genre of
Adventure had the most profits.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.990
But what about that drill down
that you're talking about,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.570
which adventure movies
had the most profits?

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.120
Well, here I also have a dimension for
Movie Title,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.860
and what I can actually do is
I can drag that onto genre and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.990
it's going to create a hierarchy for
me, okay?

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.602
So now up here I can see a plus sign
next to Genre and if I click on that,

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:14.640
I can see the movie titles that
are next to the genre, right?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.156
And so now I can start to see,
within that Adventure category,

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:21.600
Star Wars actually
generated the most profits.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.300
&gt;&gt; That's very interesting.
