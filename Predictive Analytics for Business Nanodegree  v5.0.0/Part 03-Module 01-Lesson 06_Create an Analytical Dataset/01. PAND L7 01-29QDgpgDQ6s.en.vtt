00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
Now, you're ready for project two.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.045
Project two is in two parts.

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:07.170
First, you'll create a dataset by cleaning the data,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.660
then you'll spend some time with a new instructor,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.535
who will talk through how to select predictive variables for a predictive model.

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:15.345
The second part of the project,

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:18.615
we'll be building a linear regression model to make a recommendation.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:20.880
Are you ready? If so,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.830
