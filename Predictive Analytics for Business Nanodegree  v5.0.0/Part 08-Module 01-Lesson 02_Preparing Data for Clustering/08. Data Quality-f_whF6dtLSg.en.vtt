00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.240
The final step in the data prep process
is to inspect the quality of the data.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.539
This is particularly important for
missing data and outliers.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.299
These concepts are covered
in our related courses,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.019
linked in the instructor notes,
so I won't repeat them here.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.699
However the same consideration
should be made for

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.169
these as with any other
statistical process.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.692
But it is important to keep in mind
though, that since the concept of

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:30.140
distance is so important when
creating clusters, how far out

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.820
the outliers are can have a significant
impact on the clustering process.
