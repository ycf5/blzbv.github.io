00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.129
In this lesson, we will start looking
at the details of what you need to do

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.150
in order to perform a cluster analysis.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.800
The first thing we need to do is to make
sure that we have a good set of data

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.790
that provides the information needed
to be able to accomplish the analysis.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.140
Once we have that, we'll take
a look at the actual data format,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.019
to make sure it fits with
how clustering works.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.489
I'll be showing you how to do this
process in a software platform called

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:26.529
Ultrix.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.130
However, the principles you'll learn
will help you become proficient in

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:34.280
segmentation and clustering,
regardless of the tool you use.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.890
If you need a refresher on how
to generally clean up a dataset,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.390
check out the course linked
to it in the notes below.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.929
Ready?

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:42.659
Let's get started.
