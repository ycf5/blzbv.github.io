00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.629
So that finishes up our exercise and
this lesson.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.349
You should now be able to select
data based on the objective for

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:08.459
your clustering solution.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.250
You know to think about whether
there could be any bias introduced

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.500
in any historical data
that you might be using.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.470
You also know what form the data needs
to be in, as well as how to scale or

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:23.329
standardize the data to
eliminate bias in the model.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.000
And you've had practice
transforming date data types

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.910
to be used in a clustering process.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.740
So, now we have data that is ready to be
used for the next step in the process.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.980
Let's go on to the next lesson.
