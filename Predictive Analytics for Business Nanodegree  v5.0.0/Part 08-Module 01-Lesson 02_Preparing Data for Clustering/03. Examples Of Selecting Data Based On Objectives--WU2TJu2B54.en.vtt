00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.820
Understanding that there could be
a number of different objectives behind

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.279
creating segments, let's explore a few
examples of how the objective of

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.939
your analysis helps determine
the data to use for your model.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.640
For example,
to create a benchmarking system,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.010
we would definitely need data
around the store attributes itself.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.520
Data like square footage of the store,
the hours the store is open, and

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.109
how long management has been
assigned to the specific store,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.660
are just a few variables to
think about having available.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.500
Plus, you might want data on street
traffic accessibility, and how many

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.030
employees are assigned to the store,
along with how many hours they work.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.090
Population around the store
can also be important,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.480
as well as how many
competitors each store has.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.339
However, if our objective for

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.500
the segments is to create manageable
pricing rules for our products and have

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.439
them clustered into store segments, some
of the store attributes we mentioned for

00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:01.449
the first clustering objective might not
be nearly as important as say, income or

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.430
life stage demographics for
people living around the store.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.940
Distance to the competition and the type
of competition could be important,

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.849
as well as whether stores are in
a certain regulatory zone.

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:17.649
And finally, if the objective is
to optimize product allocation and

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.660
space planning, that along with area
demographics, important data to include

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.569
would be product category sales history,
sell-through, which can measure

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.979
allocation and pricing effectiveness,
and product discount trends.
