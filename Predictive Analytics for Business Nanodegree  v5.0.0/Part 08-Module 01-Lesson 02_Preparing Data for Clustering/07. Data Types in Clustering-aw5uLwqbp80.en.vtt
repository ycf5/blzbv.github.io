00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.200
Now that we've gone through the process
of collecting the right data for

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.189
the clustering process, we need to
check to ensure that we have data

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.390
types that will fit with
clustering algorithm.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.880
So in order to do the math behind
the algorithm, continuous or

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.440
ordinal variables are needed.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.450
If you don't remember what those are,

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.129
there's a link in the instructor
notes that might be helpful.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.070
What that means is that variables with
data types that are categorical, or

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.719
even date fields need to be
transformed to be used in clustering.

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.769
Some date fields can be converted
almost naturally without much thought.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.640
For example, a birthdate or
a store opening date can be

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.380
easily converted to a numeric age field,
or a years opened field.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.440
Other date fields might require a little
more thought before you can use them.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:57.329
For example, if you have
a seasonal kind of date field,

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.879
where the value is really
more about the time of year.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.439
It may make more sense to calculate the
median of the dates and then transform

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.780
the date variable to be a number of
days before or after that median date.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.299
We'll explore this more
in an exercise later.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.310
Categorical data becomes even
a bit tougher to include.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.210
If the category actually does relate
to something that is numeric, for

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:27.229
example, a size of something,
as in small, medium, and large.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.140
Then it might make sense to assign
a number to each of these in

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.000
the order they occur.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.328
This gets us an ordinal data type that
can be used in a clustering algorithm.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.089
However, if you have a variable
that describes eye color,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.740
how do you measure the distance
between blue, green and brown?

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.810
You can't just arbitrarily assign
numbers to each, where blue is 1 and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.512
green is 2 and brown is 3.

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:56.010
because the clustering algorithm will
think that blue is closer to green

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.140
than it is to brown.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:00.859
There are some algorithms
that try to accommodate for

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.400
categorical data in clustering.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.750
We will not cover these in this class.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.840
But you can find a few links
in the instructor notes

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.069
that explore this
particular type of data.
