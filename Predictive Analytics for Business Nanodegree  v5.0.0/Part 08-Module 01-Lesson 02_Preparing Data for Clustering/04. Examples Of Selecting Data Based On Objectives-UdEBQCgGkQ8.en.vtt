00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.960
Now that we have some example
of different objectives for

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.469
segmenting retail stores, let's think
about other data that could be of value,

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.559
depending on your segmentation purpose.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.589
For data related to competition,

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.390
I mention the number of nearby
competitors and distance, as examples.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.960
But additional data such
as their store type and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.929
hours, may provide added insight.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.905
The actual sales information tied
to each store that would come from

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:29.623
the transaction systems
within the company,

00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:31.795
could be a logical set of data to use.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:35.190
But you might also want to have
access to the history and results for

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:38.919
many promotional programs that
have been used in the past.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.300
In order to understand the shoppers that
actually walk in to each store, some

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:47.629
companies can provide rather detailed
data about their regular shopper,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.550
through a loyalty or rewards card
program that they may have in place.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.109
But if that's not available,
we may want to

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.149
have access to the general census
data for the area around the store.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.090
This would provide some data about the
market size, for example population and

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.890
number of households in the area,
but also give us some more detailed

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.000
demographics related to income,
ethnicity, age, and other variables.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.659
Because buying behavior is generally
correlated to demographic categories,

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.239
having this is usually
valuable in a retail setting.

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:25.159
Also helpful could be any
information that we could get

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.689
around what life stage and social groups
are geographically close to the store.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.439
These could include already segment
categories like married with children,

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.090
or fresh out of school singles,
as examples.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.359
The point here is to think through
the business purpose for creating

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.640
the segments, and then find the data
that relates most to that objective.
