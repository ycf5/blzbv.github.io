00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.200
Now that we have the data ready,
sometimes it's useful and

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.705
interesting to visualize the raw data.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.649
Tableau makes this easy to do.

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:11.989
Just select the data
prep file you just saved.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.220
You will see under the measures
there is a latitude and longitude.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.719
To place them in the workbook,
just double-click both of them.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:23.279
Then, go to Analysis and
turn off Aggregate Measures.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.210
The store locations should
now appear on the map.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.950
If you want to see how the data lines
up visually with what we'd expect,

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.589
you can select something like Snow Feb
and drag it to the size marks.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.340
We can see that as expected,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.260
there's a lot more snow in the Northeast
US in February than anywhere else.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:45.899
Feel free to explore more by taking
off one of the variables and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.890
adding another back in.
