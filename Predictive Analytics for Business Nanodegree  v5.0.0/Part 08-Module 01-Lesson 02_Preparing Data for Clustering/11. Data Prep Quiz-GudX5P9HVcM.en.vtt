00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.330
Keeping in mind the problem
solving framework.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.390
Let's start working through the business
case that I described in lesson one.

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.429
As a reminder, the retail chain is
wanting to segment its stores by seasons

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.300
to optimize product selection at
the appropriate time of the year.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.490
The first thing we will do is,
determine the data we want.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.500
And then, get it ready for
the clustering process.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.699
In this case, the data that we
need revolves around the climate

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.000
around the individual stores.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.829
As with any data analysis project, you
sometimes can't get all the data that

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.460
you might want or at least it's not in
a format that's ready to work with.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.579
In this case,

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.060
we can get most of what we want from
the National Weather Service website.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.750
And for our exercise, we've already put
together the data that we want to use.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.890
We've tied the store location to
the climate data for specific weather

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.149
station and included some additional
data that we could use for our analysis.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.719
You can find the data we'll be using
