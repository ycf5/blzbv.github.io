00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.169
As I mentioned in the previous lesson,
because of my background, I'll be using

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.320
a retail scenario as an example for
working through the concepts.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.310
But keep in mind that you should be able
to easily translate these concepts to

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.419
whatever area you work in.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.390
For example, when we talk about
customers, you may be thinking of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.580
students, employees, people visiting
a website, or responders to a survey.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.129
When we talk about stores,
you can think school sites, hospitals,

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.719
airports, or
just about anything that has locations.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.199
The point is that you will want to
gather whatever data is relevant

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.300
to your area of analysis.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:42.669
In our case, we will look at what kinds
of data are typically available for

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.130
analyzing results for retail stores.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.230
One thing to consider when you begin
your search for the right data

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.339
is to understand the objective for the
segmentation you're trying to create.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.060
In the case of retail stores, we may
want to have segments that will help

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.230
management provide a benchmarking
system to understand and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.319
evaluate the store performance.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.629
Or we may want our segments to help make
marketing or product pricing decisions.

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:11.060
Or a third objective could be to
help managers determine the best

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.655
product allocation and
space planning for each store.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.299
If you think about these objectives,
they are all a bit different.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.289
And the final clustering solution
could look different for each one.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.830
So if you think of what
data might be needed for

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.209
a specific objective versus all of
the data that might be available,

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.809
it will help you fine tune your search,
so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.790
that you don't spend extra time getting
data together that you may not need.
