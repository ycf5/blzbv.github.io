00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.715
To build a predictive model,
要构建预测模型 

00:00:01.715 --> 00:00:05.415
you first start with a bunch of data where the outcome is already known.
你先从一些已经知道结果的数据开始

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:07.760
This data is called the training set.
此数据称为训练集 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.020
The training set will have several variables,
训练集有几个变量 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.065
called predictor variables, as well as the outcome or target variable.
称为预测变量 以及结果变量或目标变量 

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:17.340
For example, if you want to predict the likelihood that a student
例如 如果要预测学生的可能性

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.730
will graduate based on some information you have about them,
会根据你对他们的一些信息毕业

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.460
you train your model using historical data on
使用历史数据对模型进行训练

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.160
students for whom you already know whether or not they graduated.
你已经知道他们毕业的学生了

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.240
The training dataset helps the model understand
培训数据集有助于模型理解

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.210
the relationship between predictor variables and the outcome or target variable.
预测变量与结果或目标变量之间的关系 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.390
The model is then applied to a new dataset where the outcomes are not yet known.
然后 模型将应用于尚未知道结果的新数据集 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.395
We call this dataset the Test dataset.
我们将此数据集称为测试数据集 

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:43.960
In the students example,
在学生中

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.040
the test data would be new or existing
测试数据将是新的或现有

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.570
students for whom we have the predictor variable data,
我们有预测变量数据的学生

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.660
but the graduation outcome is not yet known.
但毕业的结果还不清楚

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.400
You apply the model to that dataset to get
将模型应用于该数据集以获取

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.500
an estimate of the likelihood each student will graduate.
估计每个学生毕业的可能性 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.390
The more training data you have,
你的训练数据越多

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.150
the more accurately the model can predict outcomes.
模型可以更精确地预测结果 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.545
In this first project,
在这个项目中

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:06.920
you'll use a predictive model designed to predict
你会用一个预测模型来预测

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.015
the price of diamonds based on their various attributtes.
钻石的价格

00:01:10.015 --> 00:01:12.200
The model has already been trained using
模型已使用

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.725
a large dataset of diamonds where the prices are already known.
已经知道价格的钻石大数据集

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.950
You'll be using the results of the model to predict prices for
您将使用模型的结果来预测价格

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.580
another set of diamonds for which you will have their attributes,
你将拥有的另一组钻石

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.890
but the price is not known. Good luck.
但价格是不知道的 祝你好运
