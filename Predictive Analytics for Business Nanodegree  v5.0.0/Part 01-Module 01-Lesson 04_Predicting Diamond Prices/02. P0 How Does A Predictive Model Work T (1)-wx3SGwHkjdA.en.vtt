00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.715
To build a predictive model,

00:00:01.715 --> 00:00:05.415
you first start with a bunch of data where the outcome is already known.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:07.760
This data is called the training set.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.020
The training set will have several variables,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.065
called predictor variables, as well as the outcome or target variable.

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:17.340
For example, if you want to predict the likelihood that a student

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.730
will graduate based on some information you have about them,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.460
you train your model using historical data on

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.160
students for whom you already know whether or not they graduated.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.240
The training dataset helps the model understand

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.210
the relationship between predictor variables and the outcome or target variable.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.390
The model is then applied to a new dataset where the outcomes are not yet known.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.395
We call this dataset the Test dataset.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:43.960
In the students example,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.040
the test data would be new or existing

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.570
students for whom we have the predictor variable data,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.660
but the graduation outcome is not yet known.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.400
You apply the model to that dataset to get

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.500
an estimate of the likelihood each student will graduate.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.390
The more training data you have,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.150
the more accurately the model can predict outcomes.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.545
In this first project,

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:06.920
you'll use a predictive model designed to predict

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.015
the price of diamonds based on their various attributtes.

00:01:10.015 --> 00:01:12.200
The model has already been trained using

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.725
a large dataset of diamonds where the prices are already known.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.950
You'll be using the results of the model to predict prices for

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.580
another set of diamonds for which you will have their attributes,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.890
but the price is not known. Good luck.
