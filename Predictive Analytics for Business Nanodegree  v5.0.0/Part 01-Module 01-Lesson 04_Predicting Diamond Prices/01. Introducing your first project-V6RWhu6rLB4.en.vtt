00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.415
Since the program is project-based,

00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:04.545
we're going to dive into your first project.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:06.050
Now you're probably thinking,

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.920
you guys haven't even taught me anything yet.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.340
Well, you can think of this first project as a warm up.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.955
It will help you become comfortable with the project submission and review process,

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:16.620
as well as introduce you to a few of

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.235
the concepts you'll be learning throughout the rest of the program.

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:21.350
After you finish and submit your projects,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.690
it will go to one of our expert reviewers.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.255
For most projects, if there's something that needs improvement,

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:28.085
you'll get feedback on how to improve it,

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:31.925
and you can resubmit as many times as you need to in order to pass the project.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:33.955
Since this project is a warm up,

00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:36.560
you'll just submit it once, get feedback,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.615
and then move on to the next project regardless of how you did.

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:41.165
So don't worry at all.

00:00:41.165 --> 00:00:43.005
You can't fail. Just try your best.

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.460
Ready to get started?

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.340
Take a look at the next session for the description of the project. Good luck.
