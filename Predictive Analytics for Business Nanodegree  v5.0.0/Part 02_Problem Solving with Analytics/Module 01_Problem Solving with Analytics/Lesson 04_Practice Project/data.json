Do your best to do it on your own, but don't hesitate to use the resources provided when you get stuck. \n\nGood luck!",

In project zero, you applied the results of a linear regression manually by using the linear regression equation. As you add more predictor variables, manual calculations can become more complicated. The Score tool makes this easy by automatically applying the linear regression equation from a Linear Regression tool.\n\nTo use the Score tool, you connect the *O* (object) node of the Linear Regression tool to one of the input nodes of the Score tool. On the other node, you connect the data you are using to make a prediction. You must make sure that all the predictor variables used in the linear regression model are present in the input dataset used in the Score tool. Generally you can use the default configurations of the Score tool. To read more about it, you can go to the Alteryx Help page [here](https://help.alteryx.com/2018.2/Score.htm).",

You can use it to perform various operations on existing fields. For example, if you need to display units in thousands, you can select a field, and put in a formula to divide that field by 1000 for each record.\n\nTo use a Formula, you first attach an input dataset. Then, you select from the configurations what record you'd like to use. Lastly, you build the formula. You can do this by either selecting the variables and expressions you'd like to use from the middle section(see below), or you can write the formula manually in the Expression section. Field names must be in brackets. See the example below (which also serves as a hint for how to use the Formula tool in the practice project).\n\nThis tool can do a wide variety of things, and you'll learn much more about it in future lessons. To read more about the Formula tool, you can go to the Alteryx Help page: \n\n[https://help.alteryx.com/11.0/Reference/Functions.htm](https://help.alteryx.com/11.0/Reference/Functions.htm).",

In this project, you will use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds. \n\n### Project Details\nA diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction. Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. To decide how much to bid, you will use a large database of diamond prices to build a model to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. Then you will use the results of that model to make a recommendation for how much the company should bid.\n\n**Step 1 – Understand the data:** There are two datasets. *diamonds.csv* contains the data used to build the regression model. *new_diamonds_new.csv* contains the data for the diamonds the company would like to purchase. Both datasets contain carat, cut, and clarity data for each diamond. Only the *diamonds.csv* dataset has prices. You'll be predicting prices for the *new_diamonds.csv* dataset.\n\n* *Carat* represents the weight of the diamond, and is a numerical variable. \n* *Cut* represents the quality of the cut of the diamond, and falls into 5 categories: fair, good, very good, ideal, and premium. In project zero, these categories were represented by an ordinal variable, 1-5. You can decide to use the ordinal or categorical variable.\n* *Clarity* represents the internal purity of the diamond, and falls into 8 categories: I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, and IF (in order from least to most pure). In project zero, these categories were represented by an ordinal variable, 1-8. You can decide to use the ordinal or categorical variable.\n* *Color* represents the color of the diamond, and is rated D through J, with D being the most colorless (and valuable) and J being the most yellow. \n\n**Step 2 – Build the model:** In project zero, the results were provided, but now you get to calculate them. A few things are different this time around. \n* You have more potential predictor variables\n* You now know how to use categorical variables, so no need to rely only on ordinal variables. \n\nGo through the steps you’ve learned through the course to build the model and come up with a regression equation. \n\n**<font color=\"red\">IMPORTANT</font>:** When using Alteryx, you do not need to manually create dummy variables before building the model. If you select a categorical variable, like cut or clarity, then Alteryx will automatically create the dummy variables and give you the correct regression output.\n\n**Step 3 – Calculate the predicted price for diamond:** For each diamond, plug in the values for each of the variables into the equation. Then solve the equation to get the estimated, or predicted, diamond price.\n\n**Step 4 – Make a recommendation:** Now that you have the predicted price for each diamond, it’s time to calculate the bid price for the whole set. Note: The diamond price that the model predicts represents the final retail price the consumer will pay. The company generally purchases diamonds from distributors at 70% of the that price, so your recommended bid price should represent that.\n\n### Self-Assessment \nDo your best to complete the practice project on your own. Once you are done, or get stuck, take a look at the solution. We’ve provided the solution dataset, Alteryx workflow, as well as a walk through of how to complete the project. There's not necessarily one perfectly right answer.",

              "text": "#### Review the business problem\n\nThe data and business problem are identical to project zero. We have one dataset with 50,000 diamonds with data on cut, clarity, color, carat weight, and retail price. We’ll use it to build a model to predict prices for a batch of 3,000 diamonds. For this batch, we have the same information, minus the price. Ultimately, we want to recommend the bid price for the entire batch, which will be 70% of the sum of the predicted diamond prices.\n\n#### Input the data\nWe’ll start by bringing in the diamond data with an input tool. Since the data is in a csv, we’ll need to change the datatypes, so we’ll bring in a select tool and set the numeric data to double and the ordinal data to integer.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the data to get feel for it. Let’s bring in a scatter plot. There is only one continuous numeric predictor variable, carat, so let’s chart carat and price. You can see, as expected, that price increases with carat weight, but there’s a lot of variation among diamonds of the same weight. The additional predictor variables will help explain some of this variation.\n\n#### Linear regression tool\nNow we can add a linear regression tool and set the **target variable to price.** Remember that the target variable is defined as the variable that we want to predict. In this case, we want to predict price. \n\nLet’s start by adding all the predictor variables and look at the results. The first thing I check is the p-value on the predictor variables. We don’t want to include any variables that aren’t statistically significant. If the p-value is less than .05, we can be 95% confident that there exists a relationship between the predictor and target variable. \n\nFor this model, it so happens that all the predictor variables are statistically significant, so we can leave them all in. Let’s take a look at the adjusted R-squared. It’s above 0.9, which is good. While a high r-squared is not a guarantee that the model good, in this case we can have a lot of confidence that our model will explain a lot of the variation in prices.\n\nNormally the process of selecting variables includes additional steps, like checking correlation among predictor variables, ensuring a linear relationship exists, and checking other assumptions. For simplicity, we will not cover that now, but will return to it for the second project.\n\n#### Score the model\nNow that we have a model, it’s time to apply it to the batch of 3,000 to make a prediction and recommendation. For project zero you did this manually in a spreadsheet by using the linear regression equation and plugging in values. Alteryx makes this a bit simpler with a tool called a Score tool.\n\nLet’s start by bringing in the new_diamonds data set and setting the datatypes correctly, like with did for the diamonds dataset. Now, let’s bring in the score tool. We attach the linear regression to one side, and the new_diamonds dataset to the other. For now, we can ignore any of the configurations. Now attach a browse tool and a scatterplot tool so we can visualize the data.\n\nYou can see the data is a bit tighter than the larger dataset of diamonds that had actual prices. This shows that while the model does better than the one we created in project 0, it doesn’t account for all the variable. Also, we can see that some of the prices are predicted to be negative, which obviously doesn’t make sense. To correct for this, you could set a minimum price or any diamond. However, you can expect some prices to be overestimated and others underestimated. Since we're aggregating all the prices, I let the prediction as is.\n\n#### Summarize the data\n\nNext we bring in a summarize tool to add all the predicted prices together. This gives us an estimate of the total retail value of the batch of 3,000 diamonds. To come up with a bid price, we multiply this bid by 70%, since the company targets purchases the diamonds at 70% of retail value.\n",

For project zero you did this manually in a spreadsheet by using the linear regression equation and plugging in values. Alteryx makes this a bit simpler with a tool called a Score tool.\n\n#### Score Tool\nLet’s start by bringing in the new_diamonds data set and setting the datatypes correctly, like we did for the diamonds dataset. Now, let’s bring in the score tool. We attach the linear regression to one side, and the new_diamonds dataset to the other. The score tool does not require any configuration, and it will automatically apply the regression results to the new_diamonds data. The results of the Score tool will create a field called \"Score\" which represents the predicted diamond price for each of the diamonds in the new_diamonds data.\n\nNow attach a browse tool and a scatterplot tool so we can visualize the data. Select Score as the y-variable, and carat as the x-variable.",

This shows that while the model does better than the one we created in project 0, it doesn’t account for all the variable. Also, we can see that some of the prices are predicted to be negative, which obviously doesn’t make sense. To correct for this, you could set a minimum price or any diamond. However, you can expect some prices to be overestimated and others underestimated. Since we're aggregating all the prices, I left the prediction as is.\n\n## Summarize the data\n\nNext we bring in a summarize tool to add all the predicted prices together. This gives us an estimate of the total retail value of the batch of 3,000 diamonds. To come up with a bid price, we multiply this bid by 70%, since the company targets purchases the diamonds at 70% of retail value.",
