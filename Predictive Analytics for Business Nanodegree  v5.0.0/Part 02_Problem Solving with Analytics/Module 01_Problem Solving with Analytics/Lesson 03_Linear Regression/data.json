We can then aggregate the average number of tickets for each customer to get a total average number of support tickets that we predict will be submitted per week.

If we have past data on the variable we’re trying to predict, then we are data rich.  Otherwise, we are data poor.\nTo determine whether we’re data rich or poor, we need to look at our data to get a better understanding. Looking at our data set, we see that we have the following information for each client:\n\n<li>The average number of tickets each client submits per week</li>\n<li>The number of employees per client</li>\n<li>The value of the contract with each client</li>\n<li>The industry of each client</li>\n\nSince we have the number of tickets for each client, we are data rich.  \n\n<h5>Step 2: Should we use a numeric or classification model?</h5>\nOur target outcome that we’re trying to predict is a number indicating the average number of tickets we can expect per client, therefore, we should use a Numeric Model.\n\n<h5>Step 3: Is our target variable continuous or time-based?</h5>\nWe’re looking for an average per week.  So, at first glance, we might think this is a time-based problem.  If we were looking to forecast a specific number per calendar week for a period of weeks, you’d be correct. However, in this problem, we just want an average per week and are not interested in a specific calendar week.  Therefore, we will use a continuous model to solve our problem.\n",

              "text": "\n<h4> Validation</h4>\n\nNow that we’ve performed the analysis and run the Linear Regression Model, we need to validate the results of the model. In other words, is there a way to measure how good the model is?  Or in this case, is the linear expression we calculated a good fit of our data? \n\n<h5>Step 1: Correlation</h5> Using the correlation function CORREL(data_y, data_x), we can calculate the correlation between the target and predictor variable. This value is often referred to as r.  The range of r is from -1 to +1. The closer r is to plus or minus 1, the higher the correlation between x and y. In our example, the value of r is 0.987, indicating a strong correlation. \n<h5>Step 2: Calculate r-squared</h5>\nWhile a strong correlation is good, we really want to know how well the data fits our line. Fortunately, we can get a sense of how good the formula is at approximating the data by calculating the coefficient of determination, or r-squared.  R-squared is a coefficient between 0 and 1.  R-squared is interpreted as the percent of variance in observations that is explained by the model, or the explanatory power of the model. An R-squared value close to 1 would mean that nearly all variance in the target variable is explained by the model.  An R-squared value close to 0 would mean that nearly none of the variance in the target variable is explained by the model.\n\n<h5>Caution about interpreting R-squared</h5>\nHow you interpret R-squared depends heavily on the problem you're trying to model and the data you use. For tough problems, a very low R-squared may be acceptable. Also, a high R-squared may result from a poor model. However, in general, the higher the R-squared the better, especially as you add and remove predictor variables to determine the strongest predictive model. To read more about interpreting R-squared, see [here](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit).",

In this case the slope is 0.1817, meaning that for each additional employee at a client, we will receive 0.1817 additional tickets.\n<h5>Step 2</h5>\nCalculate the y-intercept point using the ['intercept'](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093632?hl=en) function, giving us a value of -7.546.\n<h5>Step 3</h5>\nCalculate the coefficient of determination, or r squared using the ['rsq'](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3094099) function, resulting in an r squared value of 0.7862.\n<h5>Step 4</h5>\nSubstitute the model results into the linear equation. Y = mX + b becomes Y = 0.1817x - 7.546 with an r-squared value of 0.7862.\n<h5>Step 5</h5>\nSubstitute 525 for X and then calculate the expected number of tickets. The equation becomes 0.1817(525) - 7.546 = 87.86 or approximately 88 tickets per week.\n",

In this demonstration, let's assume that the data we have has already been cleaned and does not have any bias to any of our variables. You can learn more about cleaning your data set in the [Creating an Analytical Dataset](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud977/lessons/62614c2d-0e8c-45e6-a225-cdc34495e911/concepts/d200ff73-f9fa-4a16-b09b-4f1d1671984f) course.\n\nOnce we have a clean data set, the next step to prepare for your Multiple Linear Regression is to understand the relationship between each of your predictor variables and your target variable. We can do this visually by graphing a scatter-plot between each predictor variable and the target variable.\n\nBefore we start, please download the file **Linear Example Data.xlsx** and explore what this data looks like. You can access the file at the bottom of the page.\n\n**Note**: If you were to plot the histogram of Average Number of Tickets, you will see that the majority of the data is between the values of 0 and 100 and not normally distributed. Let's assume that this dataset represents all of the data we have in order to continue with this example in this part of the lesson.",

              "text": "## Linear Regression using non-numeric predictor variables\n\nSo let’s talk about what happens in linear regression when you add a categorical variable to the mix of predictor variables. Here’s a general regression equation with two predictor variables.\n\n**<center> Y = &beta; <sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + &beta;<sub>2</sub> X <sub>2</sub> </center>**\n\nLike we discussed, the X's represent the values for each variable. These come directly from the data. The &beta;'s come from the linear regression model. &beta; <sub>0</sub> is the intercept. The other &beta;'s represent the relationship between the predictor variable X and the target variable Y.\n\n#### Adding a Categorical Predictor Variable\nNow let’s say you add a third variable that is a non-numeric, or categorical variable. Now putting in the actual value of a category into an equation wouldn’t work because you can't do math string variables, so we have to transform the variable somehow. An inexperienced analyst may simply assign a number to each category and plug it into the model. \n\n**<center> Y = &beta; <sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + &beta;<sub>2</sub> X <sub>2</sub> + &beta;<sub>3</sub> X <sub>3</sub></center>** \n\nLet's spend a moment exploring the problem with this. In linear regression, the coefficient or slope on each predictor variable represents the relationship between it has with the target variable. So if you transform a category into a numeric variable, you are assuming a linear relationship exists between the target variable and the category number. Since the category number is generally assigned arbitrarily, this doesn't make sense. \n\n#### Transforming Categorical Variables - Bad Example\n\nLet’s look at an example. We have a dataset with some information for each of the 50 states in the United States.",

To do so, we'll use three predictor variables: average income of that state, the % of the population under 18, and the region in which the state falls.

You assign them the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively, and run the model. The results give you the following equation:\n\n**<center> Expenditures = -530 + 0.073 Avg_Income + 1406.36 Pct_Under_18 + 6.53 region</center>** \n\nNow let's briefly try and understand the coefficients:\n* The coefficient on average income implies that for every one dollar of additional average income, that state spends 7.3 more cents per pupil.\n* The coefficient on percent under 18 implies that for every one additional percentage point of the population under 18, the state spends about $14 more per pupil.\n* The coefficient on region implies that for every increase in one region, the state spends about $6.52 more per pupil.

              "text": "#### Transforming Categorical Variables - Good Example\n\nA much better way of using categorical variables in regression is to use what are called dummy variables. A dummy variable can only take on two values, generally zero or one. You would add one dummy variable for one less than the number of unique values in the categorical variable. So if the variable is binary, you'd add one dummy. If there are four categories, you'd add three dummy variables. \n\nGoing back to our example, let's now use dummy variables to represent the categorical variable, region. To represent the four categories west, midwest, northeast, and southeast, you’ll need to add three dummy variables. Let’s create a dummy variable for midwest, southeast, and west. \n\n**<center> Expenditures = &beta; <sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub> Avg_Income + &beta;<sub>2</sub> Pct_Under_18 + &beta;<sub>3</sub> midwest + &beta;<sub>4</sub> southeast + &beta;<sub>5</sub> west </center>**  </center>\n\nEach of the variables takes on a value of either 1 or 0. If the state is in the southeast, then the value for the southeast variable would be 1 while the other two variables would be zero.  \n\nNow we didn't create a variable for northeast. That’s because the equation needs a baseline value that is not coded into a dummy variable. If a state is in the northeast, then the value for all three of the dummy variables would be zero. *You always create one less dummy variable than the number of categories* to make sure that one category is represented by zero values for the dummy variables. That one category, in this case the northeast region, becomes the category that others are compared to.\n\nNote: Many software tools, like Alteryx, will transform categorical variables into dummy variables automatically. If you were to do it manually, the data would now look like this:",

              "text": "### Evaluating an Equation\n\nLet’s do a manual calculation to demonstrate how it works. Let’s start with the following regression equation.\n\n**<center> School exp = -468 + (0.067 *x* avg income) + (1349 *x* pct under 18) - (14.4 *x* midwest) - (9.3 *x* southeast) + (16.5 *x* west) </center>**\n\nNow let’s say we have a state with an average income of 4011, % under 18 of 32.5%, and was in the northeast region. See below for the steps of the calculation.\n\n1. **School exp = -468 + (0.067 *x* avg income) + (1349 *x* pct under 18) - (14.4 *x* midwest) - (9.3 *x* southeast) + (16.5 *x* west)**\n2. **School exp = -468 + (0.067 *x* 4011) + (1349 *x* 0.325) - (14.4 *x* 0) - (9.3 *x* 0) + (16.5 *x* 0)**\n3. **School exp = -468 + 268.737 + 438.425 - 0 - 0 + 0**\n4. **School exp = 239.162 **\n\nWe’d plug in the numeric values and multiply them by their respective coefficients like this. Then for the region dummy variables, we’d plug in zeros for each of them since the state is in the northeast. Solving the equation results in a predictive school expenditure of about 239.\n\n### Interpreting the Dummy Coefficient\n\nOne way to explaining the interpretation of the coefficient of one of the dummy variable above is that it represents the average difference between the state expenditures in one region, compared to states in the northeast region, assuming all other variables are held constant. If a state in the midwest has the same pct under 18 and avg income as a state in the northeast, then we’d predict it will spend 14.4 dollars less per student.\n\nNow it's your turn to try making a prediction on your own.",

Analysts can connect to and cleanse data from data warehouses, cloud applications, spreadsheets, and other sources; easily join this data together; then perform analytics – predictive, statistical and spatial – using the same intuitive user interface, without writing any code. \n\n### Walkthrough\n\nBelow is a quick walkthrough of the Alteryx interface. We also encourage you to go through a few of the tutorials to get a sense for how the program works.\n\n#### The Tools\n\nAlong the top of the interface, you'll see several different icons that are called Tools. You can navigate to different tools by either browsing through the tabs (In/Out, Preparation, Join, etc.) or by typing into the search bar. Once you find the tool you want, you can drag it onto the canvas.\n",

Open up Alteryx.\n\n<h5>Step 2</h5>\nDrag an \"Input Data\" tool from the toolbar and onto the canvas. Click on the drop down arrow in the configuration panel and select file browse. Navigate to where you saved the Linear Example Data.xlsx file and select it, then select \"open\". \n\nSince the data is coming from an Excel document, a window will pop up asking you to choose the sheet that you want to read.  In this case, there is only one sheet labeled “Sheet1”.  Select “Sheet1”, then click the “Ok” button. \n\nIf you click on the Input Tool, and you will see the configuration window on the left side of the screen, along with a preview of the data.\n\n<h5>Step 3</h5>\nFind the Linear Regression tool from the predictive tools category and drag it into the canvas next to the \"Input Data\" tool. \n\n<h5>Step 4</h5>\nIn the configuration panel, we can set up a linear regression. First, name the model. Next select the drop down that is labeled “Select the target variable”.  Select the column called “Average Number of Tickets” because this is the variable we’re looking to predict.\n\nIn the next box, which is labeled “Select the predictor variables,” select the variables “Number of Employees, Value of Contract, and Industry”\n\nNote: There are two additional check boxes in the tool configuration. We’re not going to check these options.  For more information, see the section below the video for additional materials.\n \n<h5>Step 5</h5>\nAdd a browse tool to the “R” output of the Linear Regression tool.  Right click on the Linear Regression Tool and select ‘Add Browse After (Reports).  This will produce a report that we can read and assess how good the model is.  \n\n<em>Note: You can use spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel to do multiple linear regression with categories by creating dummy variables.

If the situation that is being modeled should not have a b0 value then you would select this option.  In this example b0 could be interpreted as the Average number of baseline tickets that any client would have, regardless of other variables.  Since this is reasonable, we likely would include a model constant, and would not check the box.  It can also be used if the model is producing a b0 value that does not make sense.  In the case of this example, if we were getting a model constant that was a negative value, then it would not make sense for the situation, and we could choose to ignore it (essentially set it to 0).  \n\n<h5>Use a weight variable for weighted least squares</h5>The second option, “Use a weight variable for weighted least squares” allows the user to set a weighting value to each row of data.  An example of when you might want to use this would be if you wanted to weight clients who were well established more than other clients who were relatively new because you felt that the Average number of tickets would be more accurate for the established clients.  \n\nThen you could add a column of data, setting the number 2 for each established client and a 1 for each new client.  This would weight the established clients twice as much in determining the equation for the linear regression.  For the sake of this example, we’re not going to use weighting.\n\nTo learn more go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression.",

Use the coefficients of the linear regression model to determine the expected number of tickets from the new client.  \n    * Avg Number of tickets = 732*(0.1116) + 825000*(0.0004858) +12.49 - 18.45\n    * Avg Number of tickets = 476.52 so we can assume 477 additional tickets as a result of the new client.\n\n2. Next, determine the amount of capacity within the firm.  \n    * With 23 resources that have a capacity of 125 tickets per week\n    * The amount of total capacity available is 23*125 = 2875.  \n    * Therefore, the help desk can handle 2875 tickets per week.  \n3. Now, we need to determine if we have enough capacity, or if we need to add resources.  \n    * We are currently receiving 2800 tickets per week, therefore\n    * We currently have excess capacity of 75 tickets per week.  \n    * The new client will need support for 477 tickets per week, so we don’t have enough capacity to support the new client.  \n    * We need enough resources for 402 additional tickets per week, or 402/125 = 3.216 resources.  \n\n<em><center><h5>Therefore, we need to add 4 additional resources.</h5><center><em>\n",
