00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.660
Having correlation between
our predictor variables,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.170
will not cause much issue during the
building of a classification model, but

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.235
will cause issues during
the prediction time.

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:15.580
Let's go through the list of potential
predictor variables and use logic and

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.489
correlation to remove duplicate or
inter-correlated variables.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.940
If we look at the top two most
associated variables to churn,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.050
they are total day in minutes and
total day in charges.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.080
If we logically think about it,
I would assume that

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.280
the amount a person is charged on
their phone bill for daytime calls

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.850
would be directly related to how many
minutes they talked during the day.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.570
On the left side, we have
a correlation matrix that visually

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.470
represents the Pearson correlation
values between the different variables.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.570
If we look at this,
we can see the total day charge and

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.130
the total day minutes has
a very bright red block,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.760
meaning those variables
are highly positively correlated.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.110
The values associated with
it are also 1, meaning,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.140
they're perfect positive correlators.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.676
To go even further, in the scatterplot
on the right hand side,

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:13.880
that you can see as
the total.day.minutes increases,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.100
the total.day.charges moves
exactly in parallel with it.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.500
I would say that not only are these
variables inter-correlated,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.110
but they are duplicate variables.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.420
With this being said,
we should remove one of the variables,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.310
since they are redundant.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910
And having these duplicate
fields will cause

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.060
errors during the prediction
time of the analysis.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.960
Looking at the list of potential
predictor variables again,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.210
since the total.day.minutes field has
a slightly greater association to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.740
turn than the total.day.charge field,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.940
I will keep that field and
remove the total.day.charge field.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.880
Let us now look at the full heat plot of
all the variables against each other.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.150
By looking at the full graph,
I'm scoping out three things.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.100
One, where are very red blocks?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.050
These very red blocks represent highly
positively correlated variables.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.470
The second thing I'm looking for, are
very blue boxes which represent highly

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.550
negative correlation between variables.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.720
The third thing I'm looking for,
is little to no color,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.840
what this represents is little
correlation between our variables.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.840
Now we'll observe variables that
have very little correlation,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.120
since these are the variables that
can be used as predictors together,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.110
since they have very
little inter-correlation.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.396
If we look at the total.intl.minutes
versus the total.eve.minutes

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:42.381
we can see that the correlation between
the two variables is very low at 0.02.

00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:46.518
In the scatterplot,
we see no patterns and total randomness,

00:02:46.518 --> 00:02:51.690
meaning that the movement in one
field does not effect the other.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.820
This is exactly what we are wanting
in our predictor variables.
