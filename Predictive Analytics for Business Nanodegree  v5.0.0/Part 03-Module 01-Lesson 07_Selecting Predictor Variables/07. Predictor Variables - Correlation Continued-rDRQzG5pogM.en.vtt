00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.760
The values for these fields are 0.209,
which is a total positive correlation.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.270
So that means that as the total
day in minutes goes up, so

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.970
does the amount of true values.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.680
What I also notice is the p-values
are less than 0.05 which

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.710
as we learned in Patrick's lesson means
they are statistically significant.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.430
This stars to the right are an indicator
of the significance and simply,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.200
the more stars means the more
significant they are.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.290
This chart that we're able to get from
Altrex does a good job at showing

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.830
what variables we should consider for
using in our model.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.180
With this list we now
need to go into examining

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.330
intercorrealation within
our predictor variables.
