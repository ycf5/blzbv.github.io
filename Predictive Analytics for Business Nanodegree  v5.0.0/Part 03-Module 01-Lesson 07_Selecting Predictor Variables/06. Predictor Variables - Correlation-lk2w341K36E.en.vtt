00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.430
So we applied logic to get a list
of potential predictor variables.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.000
Then we made sure that there were no
duplicate variables, and now the last

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.750
thing we want to do is check
correlations between our variables.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.970
Correlation is a measure of
association between two variables.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.240
In layman's terms,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.680
this means if one variable moves,
does another variable move in parallel?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.750
The correlation coefficient
values range from -1 to 1,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.020
with 1 being a total
positive correlation,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.060
zero having no correlation and
-1 having total negative correlation.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.030
Going a little further, figuring
this out can tell us two things.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.960
The first thing would be what may be
a good quality predictor variable.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.050
And the second thing being determining
if there's inner correlation

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.700
between our predictor variables.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.010
So correlation is measured using
different types of association, Pearson,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.810
Spearman or Hoeffding's.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.530
In this course, we'll be using Pearson
by default, yet more can be read on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.840
the differences between the correlation
types in the reading notes.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.184
Let's now take a look at our data and
the correlation measure through Pearson

00:01:15.184 --> 00:01:19.115
association plus their corresponding
scatter plots over on Alteryx.
