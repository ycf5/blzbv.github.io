00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.200
After we apply logic to get a list of
possible predictor variables down,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.890
let's make sure we're not
using any duplicate variables.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.050
A duplicate variable is simply
just a variable that represents

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.220
the exact same thing
as another variable.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.900
An example of this would
be homeowner and renter.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.860
Since a yes or

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.040
no response to a homeowner also answers
the question if a customer is a renter.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.340
Another example would be age group and
age.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.619
Or in baseball, runs and runs per game.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.680
All these variables
represent the same thing.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.690
Meaning we would have two of the same
predictor variables in our model.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.600
When we have duplicate variables in our
model, it will hinder our ability to

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.390
predict, therefore we should
just choose one and go with it.
