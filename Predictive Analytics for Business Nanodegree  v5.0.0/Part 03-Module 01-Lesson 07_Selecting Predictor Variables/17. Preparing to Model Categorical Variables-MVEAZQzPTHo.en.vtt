00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.270
Now that the null values
are gone we can start to analyze

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.982
your data a little further.

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:07.650
What we're going to look at
is categorical variables and

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.290
examine the frequency of each value.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.090
Why do we care about the frequency
of the group within the variable?

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.920
Well if we have a very small percentage
of a group it may be hard to either one,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.190
predict it.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.000
Or two, use it as a predictive variable.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.320
For example,
if we have a predictive variable such as

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.670
do they have an international plan or
not?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.901
And the data is very
skewed to the true or

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.900
the false side then it wouldn't be
a very helpful predictive variable.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.510
There are some advanced techniques to
correct for this, such as over sampling.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.070
But we won't go into them for
this course.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.720
If you do want to learn
more about over sampling,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.320
there's a link in
the notes on this page.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.920
For now let's use the tools in to
determine the frequency of our

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.240
categorical variables.
