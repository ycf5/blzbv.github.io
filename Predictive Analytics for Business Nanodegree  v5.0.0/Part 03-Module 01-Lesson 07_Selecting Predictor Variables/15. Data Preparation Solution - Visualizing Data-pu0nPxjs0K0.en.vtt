00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.860
In the last video you saw me use
a summarize tool to get the count

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.540
of the number of null
records within our data set.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.170
I'm going to show you another approach
though which is going to be using

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.160
the field summary tool
to get a percentage

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.050
of the amount of null
records within out data set.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.400
So I already have my input data tool,
my churn data connected.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.380
Now what I'm going to do is go
to my field summary tool and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.430
ask to get a full analysis of
all of my different fields.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.860
Then I'm going to bring out a browse
tool after this interactive browse,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.770
we kick off this work flow and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.060
then we're going to open up
the browse tool after this.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.590
With this interactive browse, we're
able to see a few different things but

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.250
what I want to focus on in this
video is this green ticker bar.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.440
What this represents is
the number of available records,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.350
meaning how many records are valid
within this individual field.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.690
As you can see, the phone number for
example, is 100% available.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.280
If we go down to the number
of voice messages,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.840
we can see that 74% is missing.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.970
Meaning we have 74% of null or
empty records.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.578
We also have 2% over here for
total day calls and

00:01:08.578 --> 00:01:13.250
we have 2% down here for
the total night calls as well.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.526
So now what we got have to do is use
some of the techniques that we've

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.730
learned over on Maurine's course
to decide how we want to deal with

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.220
these three individual fields and
their missing records.
