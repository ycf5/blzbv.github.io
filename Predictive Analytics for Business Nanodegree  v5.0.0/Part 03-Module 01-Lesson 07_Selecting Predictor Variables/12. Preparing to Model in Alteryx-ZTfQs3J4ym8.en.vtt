00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.346
Now let's open up that data set
called ChurnData.yxdb again,

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:07.450
like we saw in the association analysis.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.370
What you're able to see is that
we have lots of null values

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.020
throughout this data set.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.100
And what I'd like you to do is clean
up our data using the techniques

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.560
you've learned in the missing
data section of Maureen's course.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.208
First thing I'd like you to do is
identify in the data set the number of

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:25.741
null or empty values.

00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.918
And then after that,
take the optimal approach at fixing and

00:00:28.918 --> 00:00:31.010
cleaning up this data set.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.340
I'll meet you again on the other
side of this data prep.
