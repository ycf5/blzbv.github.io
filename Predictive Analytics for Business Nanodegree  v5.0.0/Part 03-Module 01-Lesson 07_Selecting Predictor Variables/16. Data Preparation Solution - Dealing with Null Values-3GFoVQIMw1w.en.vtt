00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.880
In Maureen's section, we learned of
different ways to deal with null data,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.880
such as filtering out records that
are null, removing fields in whole, or

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.030
imputing in various ways.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.090
My thought is that since the percentage
of missing values in the number of

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.090
voicemail fields is so high at 74%,
we shouldn't filter those

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.490
out since it would actually just
reduce our data set way too much.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.878
As well if we imputed such a large
percentage of missing records,

00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:33.610
it will most likely cause
a bias in our data set.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.970
So my thought is to simply just,
we should ignore it for the analysis.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.980
The way we're going to do that is,
let's go back to our workflow and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.920
just bring in the select tool to
just simply deselect that field.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.630
So we can bring in that select
tool in our stream already,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.110
go to the number of voicemail field,
and simply deselect it.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.360
Now we have our two other fields that we
need to deal with our null records for

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.880
the total night calls, and
the total day calls fields.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.040
Both of those percentages were at 2%.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.395
So my though is that we should just
simply filter those records out since

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:14.220
2% is not going to cause to many records
to go away for the total data set.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.100
So now what we need to do is
remove those two different

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.580
fields that have null records
within that 2% of our field.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.430
So we're going to use
a filter tool to do this.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.850
I'm going to drag this right
in between our stream.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.820
We're then going to state
a custom filter and

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.450
this custom filter is
going to tell us two things.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.170
The first thing is we do not want nulls
that are inside of our total night calls

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.560
field, and we don't want nulls that
are inside of our total day calls field.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.880
So, the way we're going to do
this custom filter is first,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.490
we're going to go to our functions tab.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.180
We're then going to go to
our operators and state not.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.090
The whole reason we want that not first,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.760
is because we're going to go down
to our test part and say IsNull.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.080
So, what this statement right
here just says, is not null.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.480
Then that v that's
currently right there,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.620
is that variables that we want
to place inside of there.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.160
So the first one we need to
state is total days called.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.720
So what this whole part says right here,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.360
is we do not want nulls within
this total days called field.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.910
Everything that is not null is going
to come outside as true value.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.200
Anything that is null within that field
is going to come outside as false value.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.210
We need to now do this for
both of our fields, so

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.890
I'm going to do an and
statement in between.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.620
And now I'm going to just
manually type out the is null,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.800
because in my opinion it's just
a little bit quicker to write it out.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.855
So now he says is not null for
now our total evening calls.

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:40.985
When I hit run now, we should see
that we have totally clean records

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:44.845
outside this true and
as well inside this interactive browse.

00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:46.325
Because within this interactive browse,

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:49.310
we can now see that there's
no percentage missing

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.120
In that total day's call field as
well as the total evening call field.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.320
All of those no records actually went
outside this false value over here.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.680
And if we drag over to our field we can
see total day calls are no over here

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.260
as well as total night calls as well.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.600
That's exactly what I was expecting.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.230
After running this, we see that on
the false set, we have 95 records which

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.570
represent the records that do have null
values in either one of the fields.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.075
The true data is now our cleaned
up data set, with no null values.

00:03:22.075 --> 00:03:25.825
So what we should do is we should
save off this data set with an output

00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:27.235
data tool.

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:30.442
So let's delete these two tools now
because we know that our data set

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:30.955
is clean.

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:33.517
So let's now bring in
an output data tool.

00:03:33.517 --> 00:03:35.357
Bring it in after the true result.

00:03:35.357 --> 00:03:36.417
And let's save this off so

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:39.967
we can use it again continuing
forward in further analysis.

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:43.857
And we no longer have to bring in
a select tool and a filter tool.

00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:48.107
So hit the drop down menu,
go to file browse.

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:51.047
I'm going to say that this
file's a YXDB file, and

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:55.780
I'm going to call it churn data cleaned.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.270
You can call it whatever
you would like and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.270
save it whatever folder you would like.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.880
I'm going to hit run, that file
is now going to be saved out and

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.570
I'm going to now, in the work flow
bring in just this now input data so

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.470
I don't have to bring in a select and a
filter every time to clean up this file.
