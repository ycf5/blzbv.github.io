00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.900
Now that we've learned how to
interpret correlations between

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.290
variables using a couple
different plots,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.070
let's learn how I was able to create
these plots in the first place.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.800
So let's move over to Ultrex and examine
how we are able to create a workflow to

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.449
build these correlation values
between our different variables.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.740
Over on Ultrex, the first thing we're
going to do is use an input data tool

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.550
to go grab our data set.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.250
So we bring in the input data tool
towards the configuration menu in

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.620
the drop down menu and
go to our ChurnData.yxdb file.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.790
The first thing I want to do is
look at the preview menu to view.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.920
What different fields and what does my
data look like inside of this data set.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.430
So it looks like we have some
information about each of the customers.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.830
So what state they're in, how long
they've been a customer, phone number,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.110
area code,
do they have an international plan or

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.670
not as well as some call history level,
so aggregated up to the customer level.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.860
So things like how many total
daytime calls do they have?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.390
How many total daytime minutes
do they use the phone for?

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.520
Evening, night, international, etc.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.400
And then at the far right hand
side we have this churnfield and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.280
this is what we're trying to understand.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.830
If they do churn,
which is a true value or

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.040
they do not churn which
is a false value.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.540
So what I want to do now,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.170
is I want to determine the correlation
between our different variables.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.060
So between this churn field,
and all of these fields, and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.680
as well as these fields
within each other.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.890
So to do this, we're going to use
an association analysis tool,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.340
which is found inside of our
data investigation category.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670
So I bring in an association
analysis tool.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.700
And there's three different
configuration options and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.630
selections we need to make.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.680
The first one's deciding if
we want to target a field for

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.560
more detailed Analysis.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.220
And in this example, we're trying to
understand that churn field more, so,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.820
yes, we do have a target field that
we want to understand more about.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.180
So let's check on this.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.130
Then we state what that target
field is which is our churn field.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.500
Then over here, they asked us something
about the target level of interest.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.050
This is going to be, do we want to
understand more about the true or

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.479
the falses or the yeses or
the nos or the ones or

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.880
the zeros, don't focus on this too much.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.470
The only thing that this is going to
mean is basically do we want to have

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.500
positive correlations
with true values or

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.710
negative correlations with true values?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.040
But don't focus on this quite too much.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.770
The second main option that we have
inside this association analysis tool

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.480
is determining what fields and what
variables do we want to possibly add

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.580
to this model and to determine the
correlations of between each other and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.970
as well between the target variable and
these potential predicted variables.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.656
And for our examples we are going to
just simply select the all for now.

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:47.650
The third and last option is we have to
choose of what measure of association

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.010
are we going to judges
on correlation of,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.270
of it could be Pearson's,
Spearman's or Hoeffting's.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.020
As you remember in the previous
sections I mentioned that we're

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.230
only going to focus on Pearson for
this example, so

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.780
we'll just keep it at
default as Pearson.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.400
The next thing I want to do is bring
out a browse tool after the R or report

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.110
output and then another browse after
the I or interactive browse output.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.480
I'm now going to kick off this workflow
and then we can review the results next.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.330
Let me first grab that report output.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.550
By maximizing it, down it and
drag it over to our other screen.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.790
As you can see, these are the exact
same results that we saw in the previous

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.830
examples before where we're trying
to understand that Churn Field and

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.790
then the level of association all these
potential predictor variables have to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.200
that churned field.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.870
It's going in descending order so

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.560
at the top is the most
associated variables with churn.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.740
So the number of customer service calls.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.820
Then the total international minutes,
then international charge etcetera.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.440
What we're also able to see is those P
values are the statistical significance

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.290
that these variables
have to that churn field.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.650
Simply the more stars the more
statistically significant they are.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.110
And it looks like we have five variables
that are statistically significant and

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.090
I would examine them
more in the next section.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.610
So this is the report
output that we saw before.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.460
Now let's go to that interactive browse.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.140
Inside this interactive browse, we have
two different parts, like we saw before.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.589
We have a correlation matrix
on the left hand side.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.490
And a scatter plot on
the right-hand side.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.829
What we're looking for
are those three things.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.530
Very red marks for positive correlators,
very little color for

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.200
no correlation, and blue for
negative correlation.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.230
So let me just select on two
values against each other,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.330
which this shows has a 1.00 correlation
between these two variables.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.090
And as we see on the right hand
side the total night minutes and

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.730
the total night charge.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.980
As you see the value was 1.00
meaning they are perfect

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.430
positive correlators within each other.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.535
As well as you can see
on the Scatter Plot.

00:04:50.535 --> 00:04:54.315
As one moves, the other one moves
directly in parallel with it.

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:57.215
These two things, I would assume,
are duplicate variables, then,

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.505
and we probably should include
both within our model.

00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:03.930
The other thing that we can see
are two variables that are Have

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.480
very little correlation
between each other.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.180
Like these 2, for example, have a 0.03
correlation between each other.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.820
And so total day calls and
then total international minutes.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.170
Since these are two potential
predictor variables.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.130
We see that there's little to
no correlation between them.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.150
Therefore, I can assume
that these are safe

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.640
to both use within that
predictive model later.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.910
I'm able to determine that based off
the very low correlation number here

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.950
at 0.03, as well as,
in the scatter plot I see no real trends

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.780
within these two variables
against each other.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.650
So this is an example of how
you're able to develop a workflow

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.980
to then view the correlation matrix,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.820
the scatter plots and the report output
to determine the correlations between

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.440
your target variable and
your potential predictor variables.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.700
And also examining if there's any
innercorrelation between your predictor

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.250
variables.
