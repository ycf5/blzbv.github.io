00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.190
Let's quickly take a step back and

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.950
review what we've learned
up to this point.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.029
You've learned how to identify
what is a target variable.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.750
You've also been able to identify
what a predictor variable is.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.360
And lastly,
you've learned how to identify

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.110
which predictor variables to
potentially use in our model.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.520
Now it's time to actually solve
some classification problems.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.930
Well I know that Maureen would be
upset if you just went through

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.150
her course learning how to prepare data
and didn't use some of those techniques.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.790
But don't worry, in this section we're
going to take the data preparation

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.990
techniques that you learned and apply it
in our course in ways such as, dealing

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.070
with dirty data, and considerations
when working with categorical variables.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.930
So let's get started.
