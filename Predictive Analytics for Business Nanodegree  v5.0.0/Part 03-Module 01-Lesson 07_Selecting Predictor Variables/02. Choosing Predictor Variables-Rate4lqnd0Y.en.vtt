00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.170
I know this sounds silly, but

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.300
the first key to choosing
predictor variables is use logic.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.080
Decide what you think is the best chance
to build a model and just choose that.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.990
What we'll try to predict
this example is whether or

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.030
not a customer's going to renew
their cellphone contract?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.050
Now, the first thing we should
do is just use logic determine

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.820
what might be good predictive
variables in this scenario.
