00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.330
Now that we've learned a bit about
the importance of categorical variables,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.790
how about we go back to all tricks to
view how to actually analyze them.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.170
What we can use is the frequency
tool with our cleaned up data to

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.250
take a look at our target field, churn,
since it is a categorical variable.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.710
First thing we should do is just
grab that cleaned up data set.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.640
So we're going to use an input
data tool to go grab it.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.390
The drop down menu, and
then churn data, cleaned.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.670
The next thing I want to do, is go back
to my data investigation category and

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.549
grab this frequency table tool.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.180
Inside of this, we can ask to
get a frequency result from

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.250
all of our different
categorical string variables.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.560
What I'm going to choose.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.720
Is just that one churn field.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.460
And then I'm going to bring in
a browse after our interactive output,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.310
then hit run to run this analysis.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.300
One of the first things I want to
know about my different categorical

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.260
variables, is how many unique
groups it has within it.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.990
In this case since this churn field
is a binary field, it's a true or

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.750
a false, clearly we have two different
unique options, true And false.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.780
Then the next thing I look for
is that frequency and the percentage

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.460
of our different categories
within this individual variable.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.210
And it definitely looks that we have way
more false values than our true values.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.590
It seems that we actually have about 86%
false values and about 14% true values.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.950
And if we go to the frequency,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.970
we're able to see that we have 4,200
false values and 700 true values.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.200
What I get from this result is,
that since there's so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.880
many more false values than true values

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.680
It may actually be difficult to
predict just a few number of records.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.440
If this is something that does seem
actually logical in the large scheme of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.160
things, more customers are going to
stay with their cell phone carrier

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.860
than actually churn over and
go to another carrier.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.800
But, what I wanted to show you is,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.510
how you actually analyzed your different
categorical variables within Alteryx,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.440
and, hopefully, you're able to see how
easy it is to perform this analysis, by,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.990
simply, just bringing in
a frequency table tool.
