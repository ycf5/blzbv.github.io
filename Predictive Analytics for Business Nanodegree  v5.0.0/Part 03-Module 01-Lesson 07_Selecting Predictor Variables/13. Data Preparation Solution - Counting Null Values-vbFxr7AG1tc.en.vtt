00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:03.400
In Altryx, there's a few different
ways we're able to determine

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.110
how many null values we
have within our data set.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.130
The way that I chose
to go about this and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.590
I think them easiest way to do
is using a summarized tool.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.978
So, let me bring one summarize
tools into the canvass.

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:17.830
Let me drag that in between my
input data tool and my browse tool.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.150
I am then going to highlight
all of my different fields,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.610
meaning I want to make actions
on all of these fields.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.420
The action I'm going to make is within
this add section which is going to be

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.510
counting the null values.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.230
This is then going to output all
of those different variables and

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.370
renaming the fields a little bit.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.200
Let me kick off this workflow now.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.760
What I'm able to see is that most
of my fields have no null values,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.080
as you see zero here.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.940
Yet this number of voicemail
messages has a very high value

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.600
of missing records.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.570
As well, we have some within
the total date calls.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.490
And we have 95 over here at
the total night cost as well.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.280
This is in my opinion the easiest
way to just get a simple count

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.430
of the number of null
records within our data set.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.330
There are some other approaches
like I mentioned before,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.030
a great way to analyze nulls within
our data set as a holistic approach

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.290
is looking through a field summary tool
which will give us the percentage of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.470
missing records within this data set.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.290
This is an approach we might
take later to determine

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.770
how we want to actually deal with
this number of missing records.
