00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.820
Both the Holt's Linear Trend and
Exponential Trend Methods are great for

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.029
forecasting a time series
without seasonality.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.380
Sometimes however, our model can over
forecast results since the forecast

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.169
generated display a constant trend line
extrapolating values into the future.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.900
Damped Trend Methods are a solution
that implements a parameter

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.060
that dampens the trend line into a flat
line, some time into the future.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.400
And they can be both applied in
additively and multiplicative fashions.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.000
You'll hear this dampening
parameter be called Phi.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.590
Models with small values of
Phi assume that the trend line

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.090
changes only very slowly over time.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.290
While models with larger Phi,
assume that it's changing more rapidly.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.370
If you're unsure if a damped
method should be implemented,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.590
then you can run a damped model and
its original version side by side, and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.590
then check the forecasted errors to see
which one fits your time series better.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.880
We'll jump into model comparison at
a later lesson, but with time series

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.820
forecasting, we'll be testing numerous
models against the same series.
