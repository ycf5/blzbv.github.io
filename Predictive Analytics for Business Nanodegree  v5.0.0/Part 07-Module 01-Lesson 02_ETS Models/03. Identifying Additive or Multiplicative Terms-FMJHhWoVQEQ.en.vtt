00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.290
Selecting whether a time series exhibits
additive or multiplicative behavior in

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.180
its terms relies on the analyst's
ability to see trend, seasonal and

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.500
error patterns.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.411
While visualizing the data
doesn't seem very scientific,

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:15.790
it's one of the most effective ways
to determine how to apply a model.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.151
The additive method is
useful when the trend and

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.993
seasonal variation are relatively
constant over time.

00:00:20.993 --> 00:00:24.923
Whereas, the multiplicative method
is useful when the trend and

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:30.030
seasonal variation increases or
decreases in magnitude overtime.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.960
Determining the method for

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.460
the trend component is a little easier
to spot than the seasonal factor.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.405
With trend, we can see in our chart that
additive trends show a linear behavior,

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.670
while multiplicative exhibits
exponential behavior.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.200
The seasonal component
can be a little tougher.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.910
Let's use Bates Hotel
to better help explain.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.560
If Bates Hotel where to increase its
bookings in January by 1,000 bookings

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.750
each year, then we would simply
add the 1,000 bookings or

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.320
use an additive method to account for
the fluctuation.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.660
In Bates Hotel increases each
January at a rate of 50%,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170
that is increase by a factor of 1.5,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.380
the seasonal component should be
applied with a multiplicative method.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.130
Looking at the bookings time series
plot, or going back to our decomposition

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.210
plot, we see that the size of the
seasonal variations increases over time,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.410
indicating multiplicative
versus constant variation,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.660
which would indicate additive.
