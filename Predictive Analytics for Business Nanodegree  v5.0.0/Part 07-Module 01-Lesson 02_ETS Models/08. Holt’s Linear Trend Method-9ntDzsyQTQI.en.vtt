00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.540
The simple exponential smoothing method
was expanded to include forecasting data

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.850
with a trend.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.700
This new method is called double
exponential smoothing, or

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.830
Holt's linear trend method.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.210
The method builds off of simple
exponential smoothing by including

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.470
not only the level, but
also the trend in its calculation.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.340
It does this by combining
two smoothing calculations.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.980
One for the Level, and
one for the Trend.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.620
The Trend in this method is then always
applied in a linear or additive fashion.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.610
By adding this component to this
simple exponential Smoothing Method,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.260
our forecast will no longer be flat,
but will be able to trend upward or

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.290
downward.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.050
Hence, the forecasts
are a linear function.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.330
Holtz linear method is a great model
to apply to any non seasonal data set.
