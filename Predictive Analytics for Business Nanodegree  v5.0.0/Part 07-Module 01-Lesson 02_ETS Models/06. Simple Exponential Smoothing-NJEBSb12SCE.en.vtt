00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.227
To get a better understanding of
the concept of weighted averages.

00:00:03.227 --> 00:00:06.630
And how a simple exponential
smoothing method is calculated.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.144
Let's jump over to Excel and

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:12.068
apply a weighted average to a series
of points and predict the next value.

00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:16.006
Our Stock_Weekly_Values.xlxs
has four columns.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:20.137
The Date, the closing value of
the stock, a column for our weights, and

00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:21.870
a Forecast column.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.440
Notice that if you sum up the weights,
they add up to 1.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.850
This represents one full
period in the time series.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.299
I've also left an alpha calculation
at the bottom of column E.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.980
This displays how we can calculate
the decay of our weights for

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.360
an exponential smoothing method.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.500
You'll see the four values in the alpha
column match the last four weights.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.080
That is because our weights column
is actually an exponential decay

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.220
calculation of alpha value 0.6.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.546
The calculation for

00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:53.608
this is alpha multiplied by
the difference of 1 minus alpha.

00:00:53.608 --> 00:00:56.983
Raised to the power of the number
of time periods behind our most

00:00:56.983 --> 00:00:57.820
recent value.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.925
Let's start our forecasting calculation
by multiplying each value from our

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:05.645
closing values column against
its respective weight.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.360
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.323
Now, sum up the values at
our Forecast column and

00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:13.860
you'll have the next forecasted value.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.071
You could then continue this process
to extrapolate your forecast into

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.880
future periods.
