00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.360
The last method will
look at accounts for

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.590
all three components,
that can be found in the time series.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.579
The Holt-Winter Seasonal Method
comprises of forecast equation with

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.364
three smoothing equations, one for
the level, one for the trend,

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:15.766
and now, one for the seasonal component.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.451
Again, we can use the two variations
of application in the method,

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:21.464
both additive and multiplicative.

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:24.152
To review, the additive
method is used when seasonal

00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:27.390
fluctuation does not change
in magnitude over time.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.300
Whereas the multiplicative method is
used when seasonal fluctuation changes

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.840
in magnitude.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.130
The Holt-Winters Seasonal Method can
also be used with a damped parameter,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.160
and is one of the most widely regarded
methods for forecasting seasonal data.
