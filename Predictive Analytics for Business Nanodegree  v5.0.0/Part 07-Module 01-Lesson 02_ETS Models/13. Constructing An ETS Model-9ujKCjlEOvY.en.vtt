00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.650
Now that we've covered exponential
smoothing models in detail, let's begin

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.220
construction on a model to forecast
bookings for Bates Hotel using Alteryx.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.620
We'll begin by dragging and dropping
an Input Data tool onto the canvas and

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.185
loading in the Bookings xlsx.

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:17.009
We'll be using this data to forecast
the next six months of room bookings.

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.645
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:24.400
Next, bring in a Record ID tool.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.950
All this does is number our records,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.150
but doing this will allow us to
filter out a holdout sample.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.170
We'll get more in depth on holdout
samples later in the course.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.413
For now, we'll filter out the last six
records in our time series to use as

00:00:36.413 --> 00:00:40.657
the holdout sample, by setting our
filter to include records less than or

00:00:40.657 --> 00:00:42.241
equal to RecordID 114.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.297
Now that we've prepared our time series
data for model construction, we can take

00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:49.939
a look at the time series plots to
determine how we should apply our trend,

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:53.560
seasonal and error components
in our model calculation.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.760
We'll connect a Record ID
tool to a TS Plot tool.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.050
In the TS Plot tool configuration, we'll
select Bookings as the target field,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.100
Monthly for our target field frequency,
and Time series plot as our plot type.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.190
Now, add a Browse tool to the
interactive node of the TS Plot tool.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.040
You can do this by
right-clicking on the tool and

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.810
selecting Add Browse After
(Interactive).

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.280
Now hit Run.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.430
The interactive output for the TS Plot
shows us a vast amount of information.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.040
Let's take a look at
the decomposition plot.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.270
From this plot, we can tell our
trend moves in a linear fashion,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.920
suggesting applying trend additively.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.950
The seasonality within our time series
data looks to be about the same

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.850
every year.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.750
But is it?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.558
The seasonal portion of our
decomposition plot allows us to that

00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:38.260
confirm is this is true.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.510
Looking at the seasonal peaks and
valleys,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.180
we can see that seasonality increases
in volume each seasonal period.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.200
This suggests applying seasonality
in a multiplicative manner.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.675
Lastly, our remainder, or error,

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:54.080
shows changing variance as
the time series moves along.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.940
This means we should use
error multiplicatively.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.390
The next step after determining
the fashion of how to apply our trend,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.360
seasonal, and error components, will
be to build a model using the ETS tool.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.130
Let's drag and
drop an ETS tool onto the canvas.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.720
We'll name our model MAM, to show how
we're applying the different components.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.540
Next, select Bookings as
the target field, and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.410
Monthly as target field frequency.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.210
On the Model type tab, we can set
the different component types.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.180
Set Error to Multiplicative, Trend to
Additive, Trend dampening to No, and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.690
Seasonal type to Multiplicative.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.140
On the Other options tab, let's input 6
as the number of periods to include in

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.190
the forecast, and set the series
starting point to 2006 period one.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.570
Let's also test if trend dampening will
have a positive effect on our model.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.150
So, copy and
paste the ETS tool on the canvas, and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.520
make sure the configuration is
the same as our first ETS model.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.790
Except now,
set Trend dampening to Yes, and

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.920
also make sure to add
dampened to the model name so

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.258
we can tell the difference when
referencing the final output.

00:02:59.258 --> 00:03:03.409
Our alpha, or smoothing value
is calculated automatically by

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.030
Alteryx to maximize error reduction,
so we'll not have to set this.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.070
Before we hit Run, auto-browse to
the R or report node of the ETS tools.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.100
We can click on the Play
button to build our models.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.554
The output from our ETS tool will
show us important information such as

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:26.260
in-sample error measures, information
criteria, and the selected alpha value.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.620
We'll discuss how to compare,
forecast, and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.890
visualize these results in lesson four.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.306
For now, save this workflow,

00:03:32.306 --> 00:03:34.984
as we will come back to reference
it later on in the course.

00:03:34.984 --> 00:03:36.149
