00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.719
Now that we've covered some of the basic
building blocks of time series analysis,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.689
we can start discussing the first model
types we'll be looking at in this

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.988
course, exponential smoothing models.

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:14.130
Exponential smoothing forecasts use
weighed averages of past observations,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.360
giving more weight to the most recent
observation with weights gradually

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.509
getting smaller as
the observation gets older.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.610
The E, T and
S terms represent how error, trend, and

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.910
seasonality are applied in
the smoothing method calculation.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.595
Each term can be applied either
additively, multiplicatively, or

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:34.336
in some cases be left out
of the model all together.

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:35.689
This framework allows for

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:39.760
a wide spectrum of time series analysis
due to simplicity of the calculation.
