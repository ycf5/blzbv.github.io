00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.740
How do we determine how to
apply the error, trend, and

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.570
seasonal terms of an ETS model?

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.650
A good way to start is to visualize
the data by using a time series

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.260
decomposition plot.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.430
What this plot does is separate the time
series into it's seasonal, trend, and

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.010
error components.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.050
Let's start by looking at the data
from our business problem.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.340
The first plot shows the actual time
series, the seasonal portion shows us

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.820
that there are seasonal pattern, we can
see in our Bates Hotel bookings that

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.610
seasonal only occurs at regular
intervals and with increasing magnitude,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.740
meaning bookings are increasing at
a larger rate each seasonal turn.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.420
Our trend line indicates the general
course or tendency of the time series.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.880
It is a centered moving average
of the time series, and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.540
fits between the seasonal peaks and
valleys.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.550
This line is considered deseasonalized.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.830
And lastly, the remainder is the error
in the model that calculates

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.740
the difference between the observed
value and the trendline estimate.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.940
It's the piece that's not accounted for
by combining the seasonal piece and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.220
the trend piece.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.800
All time series will have this residual
error to help explain what trend and

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.720
seasonality cannot.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.560
Making use of the trend, seasonal and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.780
error plots shown together
in our decomposition plot

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.200
allows us to identify these main
components of the time series.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.900
Later we can extract these component so
that we configure our exponential

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.830
smoothing model to best represent
the underlying data of our time series.
