00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.050
A variation of the Holt's Linear Trend
Method is the Exponential Trend Method.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.470
This calculation uses the same level and
trend components except for

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.500
now the level and
trend are applied multiplicatively.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.450
This means that the trend
will increase or

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.270
decrease exponentially
rather than linearly and

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.080
exhibits forecasts with a trend growth
rate by factoring rather than addition.
