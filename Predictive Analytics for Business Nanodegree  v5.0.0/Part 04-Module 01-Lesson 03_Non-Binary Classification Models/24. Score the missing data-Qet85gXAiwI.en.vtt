00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.640
So let me show you how I would go and

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.970
predict the 40% of employees who
didn't respond to our survey.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.620
The first thing I would do is I would
take our force model that we're going to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.860
use, and output the model object, so
I'm able to use it in a new workflow.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.771
So I'm going to use an output data tool,

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:27.063
go to File &amp;gt; Browse, and
save this off as Model,

00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:31.370
or ModObj_FM for Forest Model.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.460
I can then run this workflow to save off
that model object of the forest model.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.820
Like I had mentioned before,
this is just personal preference for me.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:45.180
I'm then going to go to a blank
canvas and input that model object,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.710
which I'm going to use in a score tool.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.710
Before I go ahead and bring in a score
tool, though, let me bring in another

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.890
data set, which is my 40% of employees
that didn't respond to our survey.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.316
It's titled, Missing Employees,

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:05.065
I'm then going to go to a score tool,
bring that in and

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:11.045
load in each of my input data's
into each side of the score tool.

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:14.994
They're going to bring in
a browse tool and run this model.

00:01:14.994 --> 00:01:19.934
What we're able to see now is for every
employee based off this forest model,

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:24.571
what is the predictive probability
that they take either a bike to work,

00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:28.220
they drive to work or
they take a public transportation,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.040
bus or train or
whatever it might be to work.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.465
What we should do now is turn this
predictive probabilities into one's and

00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:39.420
zeros we can get in actual count.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.770
So how I'm going to do that is I'm
going to build a conditional statement

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.300
saying if bike score was greater than
the car and the public transportation

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.050
then it should be one and those should
be zeros and vice versa all around, so

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.420
we have ones and zeros instead of just
a predictive probability percentage.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.170
With that then I can aggregate my
data up to get the count of how many

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.120
individuals should bike, drive or
take public transportation to work.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.500
So let's go ahead and
bring in a formula tool.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.600
I'm going to replace
the square bike field

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.290
by building out a conditional statement.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.522
In this conditional statement
is going to be if Score_Bike

00:02:23.522 --> 00:02:28.536
is greater than Score_Car and
Score_Bike is greater

00:02:28.536 --> 00:02:36.070
than Score_Public Transportation then
we're going to say it's one, else zero.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.460
If I run this, you can seen now we
have square bytes as 1s and 0s,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.600
yet we still have predictive
probabilities for

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.890
the score cars and
the score public transportation.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.380
So let's go ahead and do the exact same
thing for now the other two fields.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.153
So if I run this now, what you're
able to see in the browse window,

00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:03.122
because we have all 1s and 0s.

00:03:03.122 --> 00:03:07.207
So now what we want to do,
is we want to sum up all the records,

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:10.420
or all the values within
each of the score.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.550
Car, the score of public transportation,

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.600
and the score of bikes, to then get
the total count of individuals,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.940
who take public transportation,
ride their bike, or drive to work.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.410
So let's bring in
a summarize tool to do this,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.690
where I can simply go over my
score bike, score car, and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.568
score public transportation fields and
add sum.

00:03:32.568 --> 00:03:35.360
What that's going to give me is
the sum of the score of the bikes,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.960
sum of the score of the car, sum of
the score of public transportation.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.528
And we can rename those
if we choose to do so.

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:44.507
But what I'm going to do
is simply just hit Run.

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:48.530
Now, what we have here are the results
that we were expecting.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.030
What we have is the mode
of transportation for

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.730
each of the 40% of employees that
did not respond to that survey.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.860
So it looks like 913
actually drive to work.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.450
We have 481 that take
public transportation and

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.400
141 that bike to work.
