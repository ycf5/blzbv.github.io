00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.410
Let's consider a really
simplified version of

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.689
the example we just talked about.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.010
We generated a forest model in order
to predict the unknown data from

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.510
the employees who did not respond.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.710
Let's apply this model to a particular
employee who is 1.5 miles away from work

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.630
to illustrate how
the forest model will work.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.070
Remember the trees here are simplified
to demonstrate the concept.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.442
For the first tree, a random
sample of the data is taken, and

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:28.909
a tree is created from it.

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.695
Here's the tree.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:34.825
Since the employee we are trying
to predict lives 1.5 miles away,

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:39.515
this tree would predict that she has
a 50% chance of driving to work, 30%

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:45.085
chance of taking public transportation,
and a 20% chance of walking or biking.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.515
Now another tree is generated
from a different random sample.

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.308
Here's that tree.

00:00:51.308 --> 00:00:56.110
In this tree our employees predicted to
have a 20% chance of driving, 30% chance

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.310
of using public transportation, and
a 50% chance of walking or biking.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.769
A third tree is generated from
a different random sample.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.580
Here is that tree now.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.258
In this tree, our employee is predicted
to have a 30% chance of driving,

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:17.018
20% chance of using public transit,
and a 50% chance of walking or biking.

00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:19.840
In a forest model, hundreds of
trees like this would be created,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.350
and then the results of each would
be averaged to make a prediction.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.372
Let's average based off these
three trees to make a prediction.

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:34.362
So driving is 50% + 20% + 30% / 3, so

00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:38.030
it's 33% likely to be driving.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.512
The public transit was 30%, 30%,
and 20% when you divide that by 3,

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:48.890
that's 27% likely to be
public transportation.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.784
And then walking and
biking had a 20%, 50%, and

00:01:52.784 --> 00:01:56.605
a 50% chance divided by 3,
which equals 40%.

00:01:56.605 --> 00:01:59.514
So you can see that if we had
only used the first tree,

00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:01.236
that because of overfitting,

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:05.460
it may have had a very different
prediction than the forest model.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.800
It would have predicted most
likely our employee drove.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.240
But using a forest technique,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.780
it predicted that she most
likely walked or biked.
