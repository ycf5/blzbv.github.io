00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.410
When running a Forest Model,
we're going to look for

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.480
a couple of things in the results.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.950
These can tell us how solid the model
is, what factors are most important, and

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.250
possibly changes to the model to rerun.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.010
The first thing to look for is something
called the out of the bag error rate.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.440
This explains how well the model
performed with the cross validation set

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.340
in the estimation sample.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.550
This gives us a good understanding
of how solid the model performs

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.950
with just the estimation data.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.280
You can think of it in the same
terms as an R-squared value.

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:37.905
What we also look for
is the confusion matrix.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.425
This shows again how well the model
performed on the original

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:43.185
estimation data.

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:46.905
Compared to the out of the bag error
rate, the confusion matrix does a better

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:51.465
job of representing where errors
occurred in classifying the data.

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:55.415
As you've learned when we're running a
forest model we're using an ensemble of

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:56.690
decision trees.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.090
This can be computationally intensive.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.860
So let's have a look at
the percentage error for

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.500
the different number of trees graph.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.760
We can use this to help us see what the
correct number of trees is to use, so

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.340
we can avoid over computing.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.690
What we are looking for

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.040
is the number of trees it takes to
minimize the error of each of the items.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.890
So, basically, where does it flatline?

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.010
After we determine this number, we can
change the subsequent forest models

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.819
to run this data to the smaller
number of decision trees.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.730
Finally, we need to look for

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.430
which predictor variables matter
the most in this relation to the model.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.380
This is very helpful in determining
which variables are most associated with

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.180
their data and we can focus on this for
future analysis.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.760
Let's examine this things
over in Altrix, now.
