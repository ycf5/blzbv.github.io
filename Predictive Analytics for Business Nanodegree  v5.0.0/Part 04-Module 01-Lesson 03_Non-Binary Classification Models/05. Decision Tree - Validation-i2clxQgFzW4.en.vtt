00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.500
Since we built out the model already,
we can go and

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.380
use the model comparison tool to
be able to analyse the quality

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.710
of the decision tree model
with an independent sample.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.055
So what I'm going to do is go
over to my predictive section and

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:16.735
bring in that model comparison tool.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:22.885
I'm going to load in the model
object from the decision tree

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:27.497
into this model comparison tool
into the M, or model input, and

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:33.267
the validation data set from the create
samples tool into the d or data side.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:37.787
This option of the positive class in
a target variable, we do not need to

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:42.363
put in anymore since we're not trying to
predict a binary categorical variable,

00:00:42.363 --> 00:00:45.323
but rather non-binary categorical data.

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:48.813
So there's no true positive class or
negative class here.

00:00:50.643 --> 00:00:53.943
So instead, what I want to just
do is leave that blank, and

00:00:53.943 --> 00:00:56.243
put in a browse tool
after this R output.

00:00:57.243 --> 00:01:00.693
So let's maximize these results now,
and go interpret them.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:05.600
So the decision tree had an accuracy
of the estimation sample up at 96%

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.710
which is quite high.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.920
But now, what the model does not perform
quite as well with the validation sample

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.860
as the overall accuracy is much,
much lower at 84%.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.080
This make me wonder if we
can build out a better model

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.280
that's a little more reliable.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.190
This unreliability is often
seen in decision trees

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.520
due to their tendency to over fit
the model to their data sets.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.420
The other model types we're going
to use is a force model and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.200
boost models and they're both used
as an extension to decision trees,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.200
but do just a good job at
combating this over-fitting issue.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.680
Let's explore an exciting model
next called the forest model.
