00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.250
In this section,

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.020
we learn the fundamentals of using
a Boosted Model to make predictions.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.100
In it, we use sequential predictive
models that learn from one another,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.040
to classify how employees got to work.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.870
This model had an overall
accuracy of 83%.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.950
This isn't a bad accuracy rate, but

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.305
it's quite a bit lower then
we saw in the force model.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.920
This doesn't mean we should just throw
it out because we can still use it to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.520
compare our models together.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.690
How about we jump over to
the Model Comparison, now?
