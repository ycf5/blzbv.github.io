00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
In the binary classification section,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.510
we learned about decision trees which were used to predict binary variables.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.820
They do this by splitting the data and creating the largest difference of

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.285
the percent between the target group. Well, guess what?

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:17.155
They can also be used to predict non-binary classification data.

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:20.295
We'll be using this for a new business problem.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.350
Since we already learned the foundation of decision trees,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.280
let's flip over to Alteryx to build this model out.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.200
Now, what we're going to do is build a decision tree of an Alteryx,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.895
interpret the results, and validate the model.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.000
If you recall, the goal of this analysis is to predict what mode of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.650
transportation the 40 percent of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.100
employees who did not respond to the survey actually use,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.440
since we have already built out a decision tree,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.295
go ahead and bring in the data,

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:49.125
and build this model out yourself.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.860
You can then validate the model afterwards.
