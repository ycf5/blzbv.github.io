00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.272
In this section we learn
the fundamentals of the forest model.

00:00:03.272 --> 00:00:07.370
This model created an ensemble
of decision trees to classify

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.780
which mode of transportation
employees take to work.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.970
Since this model seemed very accurate,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.210
I'm excited to use to use his model on
the 40% employs that did not respond.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.970
But let's first examine another
model type since, who knows?

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.170
This model might even perform
better than the first model.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.500
Let's jump into that model now,
the boosted model.
