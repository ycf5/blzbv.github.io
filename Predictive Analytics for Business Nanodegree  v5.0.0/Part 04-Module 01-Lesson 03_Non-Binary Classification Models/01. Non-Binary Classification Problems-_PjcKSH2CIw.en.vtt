00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's learn about some non-binary
classification models.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.340
We've spent some time
learning how to prepare data,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.050
and we also solved binary problems.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.170
Now it's time to get to the good stuff.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.750
In this section, we're going to
discuss three types of models.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.220
Decision Trees, Forest Models,
and Boosted Models.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.520
Then we'll talk about
comparing the models, and

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.510
how you'll know which
one fits the data best.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.330
Before we go any further, let's discuss
what our actual business problem is.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.790
Our company's insurance policy has
a reward based benefits offer.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.430
This benefit varies depending
on what mode of transportation

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.670
an employee takes to work.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.820
So our company ran a survey to
understand the mode of transportation

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.795
of our employees, and
sadly, only 60% responded.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.170
What our management
would like to do then,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.450
is to predict the mode of transportation
of the other 40% of our employees.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.540
This would help us better estimate
what benefits we can offer.
