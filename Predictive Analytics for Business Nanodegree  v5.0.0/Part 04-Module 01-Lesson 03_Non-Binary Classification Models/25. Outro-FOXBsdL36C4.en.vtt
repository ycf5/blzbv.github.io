00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.010
Congrats you just made it through this
lesson and now let's take a full circle.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.680
This section was all about trying
to classify non-binary data.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.270
We attack this by a very
methodical approach

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.720
that was very similar to
classifying binary data.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.010
We examined our data first,
then we created samples of our data set.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.890
We tested our samples
on three model types

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.350
then we compared our models
using the validation data set.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.000
We chose our model based
on how it performed and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.340
just old fashion intuition.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.990
Now, you should take these
lessons you've learned and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.200
apply it over in a project.
