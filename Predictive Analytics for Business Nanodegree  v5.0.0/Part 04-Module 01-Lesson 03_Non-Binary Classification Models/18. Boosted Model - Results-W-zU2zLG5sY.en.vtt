00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.111
With a boosted model, there are not many
results that come out of the model that

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.870
can be interpreted in accuracy terms.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.240
To do this,
a validation of the model is needed.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.330
We will get to this part in a bit, but
for now, let's go over the two important

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.010
items that we can actually examine
in the boosted models results.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.420
The first thing we would want to look
for is the variables important plots.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.180
Just like we saw in the forest model,
this can help us know which

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.570
variable delivers the most
insight to the target variable.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.160
The other item of interest in
the results is the number of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.250
iteration assignment plot.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.660
This helps us show
the amount of variance, or

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.510
rather deviance that is
captured with more iterations.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.170
The question this answers is how many
trees are needed to create the optimal

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.679
result?

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.400
Now that we know a little background
on what we're going to look for,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.005
how about we go look at the results for
a model over in Alteryx?
