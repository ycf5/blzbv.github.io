00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.180
Now, what we're going to do is
build a forest model in Ultrix,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.420
interpret the results,
and validate the model.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.730
Now we've already created
samples of 70% for

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.230
the estimation sample, and
30% for the validation sample.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.700
So let's bring in a force model and
configure it.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.010
So we can find this force model tool
within the predictive category.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.190
The first thing we're going to do,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.150
just like all the other models
is simply name the model.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.390
So I'm going to call this FM, for Forest
Model, under score transportation,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.630
since that's what we're
trying to predict.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.620
The next thing we're going to do is
select what is my target variable,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.480
which is going to be the mode,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.470
and then lastly what are my different
possible predictor variables?

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.750
So gender, age, marital status and
drive distance in miles.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.660
And so far this is exactly
the same thing that we've done in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.040
all the previous models
up to this point.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.630
Now what are some of
the different options?

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.780
The first option is
the option rate below,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.580
which is the number of trees to use.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.060
So remember that we have
a force model here,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.370
which is an ensemble of decision trees.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.590
And even with the logo, you can see
that it's many different trees,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.480
as compared to a decision tree,
which is one single tree.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.560
This option right here
is to choose how many

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.950
of these individual decision trees
that we want to actually make.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.500
So this can be 300, it can be 200,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.150
it can be 5, it can be a thousand,
whatever you so choose.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.070
Typically, we leave it at default,
which is 500,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.850
then we go back and we change this

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.550
based off of some of the results that
we're going to review in the future.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.090
The other options could be seen in
the model customization options.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.270
What is the minimum number of
records allowed in a tree node?

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.110
So just like before, the smaller number
the more splits that are going to occur.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, the last two configuration options
revolve around a concept called

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.010
bootstrapping, which you can read
more about in the readings notes.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.890
This is a more advanced technique and
for the purpose of this course,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.830
we're going to keep these values and
options at the default places.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.720
So, I'm going to bring a browse tool
after these are our report output

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.560
there's no interactive result for
this model.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.640
So I'm going to run this, and
then I'm going to allow you to go and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.360
learn a little bit of what you're
going to be looking for in the results,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.800
in the next session.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.040
Then we're going to come back and

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.940
actually view the results
from this model.
