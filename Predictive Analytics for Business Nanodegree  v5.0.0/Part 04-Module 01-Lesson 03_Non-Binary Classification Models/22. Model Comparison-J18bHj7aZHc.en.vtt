00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.680
In Alteryx, we're going to leverage the
same tool we have been using to validate

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.110
our individual models to compare all
three of our models side by side,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.460
the model comparison tool.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.460
So, as you see on the canvas,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.480
we have all three models already built
out since we've done that already.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.870
What I'm going to do now is union
the three model objects together, and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.280
then load those into the model
comparison report, so I'm able to

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.460
determine which model actually performs
better by looking at them side by side.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.100
So, let's bring in now a union tool

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.420
to union the three model
objects in together.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.790
Then I'll bring in a model comparison
tool, and load those union results with

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.410
the model objects into the M, our model
input for the model comparison tool.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.250
And the validation dataset goes
into then the D, our data side.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.610
Let's bring in a browse tool
after the R output, and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.680
let's kick off this workflow.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.150
So now that this ran,
let's open up this result output so

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.630
we can go and interpret the results.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.970
What we're able to see here is
all the models side by side for

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.660
their fit and error measures.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.290
So, we're able to determine
each of the individual models

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.380
total accuracy with that
validation dataset,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.990
as well as how well each of the models
performed at trying to predict

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.435
each mode of transportation
within that validation dataset.

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:34.885
The other thing we're able to look
at is the confusion matrices of

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:37.935
each of the different models
with that validation dataset

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:41.165
to see if there's any trends or
biases within this model.
