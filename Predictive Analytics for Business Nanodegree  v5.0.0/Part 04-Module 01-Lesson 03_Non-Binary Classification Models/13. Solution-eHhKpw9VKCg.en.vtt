00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.740
The forest model performed
quite well with the 60% of

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.100
employees that responded to the survey.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.120
Yet just like in all the other models
presented in this classification

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.079
section, we should test the model
out with a validation sample to

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:22.490
determine how well our forest model
actually performs on independent data.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.070
So what we're going to do is just
continue on with the same workflow that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.000
we have already built out with the input
data tool, the samples of our data set,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.650
the decision tree model, or rather the
forest model, and now we need to bring

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.877
in a model comparison tool to validate
our model with a validation data set.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.360
Again we take the model object
into the end or model site and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.820
the validation data set into the D or
data site.

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:56.500
We will now bring in our browse tool
after the R over our output and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.630
kick off this work flow.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.560
Now with this tool we can see that the
model accuracy of the validation sample

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.040
is that 85%.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.980
This is again quite lower than
the estimation sample that was

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.850
predicted before,
which was much much higher.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.030
So, just like the decision tree model,
both of our results fell

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.910
from predicting the estimation sample
down to the validation sample.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.870
I think I remember that these
results are a little bit higher than

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.630
the decision tree, but we're going to
need to compare them side by side to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.440
determine which one is actually
better for prediction.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.570
Also, we may have another model up our
sleeves that we can test out to see

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.140
maybe this model might perform better
than both of these other ones so far.
