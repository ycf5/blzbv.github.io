00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.240
Let's go back to our problem where
we're trying to predict what mode of

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.790
transportation did employees take to
work, who did not respond to the survey.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.360
In all tracks we are now
going to use a boosted model

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.220
to try to predict this outcome, and then
determine how well it fared as a model.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.280
So we've already built out the input
data and the create samples tool.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.410
So what I'm going to do now is
leverage the boosted model tool,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.380
to build out this model.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.350
The first thing I'm going to
do is named the model.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.778
And it's going to be called
Boosted_Transportation.

00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:39.780
I'm now going to select my target field,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.120
which is going to be
the mode of transportation.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.870
I'm then going to select my different
predictor variables, such as gender,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.620
age, marital status, and
the drive distance in miles.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.020
I'm now going to jump over to
the model customization option.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.310
And what I'm going to do is
I want to select target type

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.990
in the lost function distribution.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.630
And really what this is just
going to tell the model is,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.540
what type of data is
the target variable?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.480
And what I'm going to choose is this
data is multinomial, meaning there's

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.280
three or more different outcomes,
and it's a categorical variable.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.160
So this option, we have three different
types of categories of mode of

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.680
transportation people take to work,
so multinomial makes the most sense.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.780
The last few configuration options
are more advanced techniques.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.520
For the purposes of this course,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.310
we're going to keep these
options at default values.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.760
You can read more about them
in the reading note section.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.170
I'm now going to run this model, and we
can examine it next in the browse tool

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.550
after we learn about what we're
looking for in the results first.
