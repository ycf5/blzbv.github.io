00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.125
Now that we've run the model, let us go
view the results in the browse tool and

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:07.570
I'll walk you through the main
points of this output.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.350
What we're able to see
first is in record one,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.600
and what I look at here is
the loss function distribution.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.860
And like we set as default before
is going to be the multinomial

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.160
option which means we have a categorical
variable that we're trying to predict.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.140
And these categories is more than two,
it's three or greater, so

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.900
these were non-binary type of
classification problem that we have.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.060
The other thing that I see is
the number of trees that were used.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.380
So before with the force
model we used 500 trees.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.740
With the decision tree,
we used one tree.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.250
Over here, he used 4,000 and
that was actually a maximum threshold.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.760
So really this model probably
took a very long time to run

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.800
because it created 4,000 trees,
but most likely,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.770
there's a very good chance it's going to
be more accurate than the other models.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.960
What I look at then is next in record
two, this variable importance plot

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.320
that we see in both the forest model and
the decision tree model.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.220
And we're able to see which
variables are most important

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.340
to each of these different models.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.000
And so it looks like,
just like we saw before,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.510
the distance that someone
lives away from their work

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.040
is the most important variable to
the model then after that, age.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.510
While gender and marital status don't
even contribute at all to this model.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.950
Record three are the number
of iteration assessment plot.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.760
What this shows is
the amount of variance or

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.030
rather deviance that is
captured with more iterations.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.350
And what this shows is
that the more trees added

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.500
the smarter the prediction became.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.280
As well the estimation sample and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.570
the in-model sample that are both
bill in this model are very close.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.360
Meaning this model performs
well on an independent sample.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.020
We're going to continue to test
how well this model performs.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.300
With the now scoring the validation
sample, with the model comparison tool.
