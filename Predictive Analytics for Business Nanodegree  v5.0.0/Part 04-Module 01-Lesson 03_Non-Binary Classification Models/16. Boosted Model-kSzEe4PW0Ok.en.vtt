00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.560
Instead of creating a bunch of random
trees, the boosted model makes one tree.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.960
The boosted model's algorithm performs
an analysis on the errors of the tree to

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.310
identify the biggest source of error.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.380
Then it changes the tree to reduce that
error and then it does the analysis

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.600
again to find the next biggest error and
then it makes changes to reduce it.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.750
It does this over and over again until
it can't make the tree any better and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.400
then we have a finished boosted model.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.640
To learn more of the mathematical
foundation of this model,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.700
just check out some links
in the reading notes.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.290
Now we will go ahead and
build out a boost model over in Altrex.
