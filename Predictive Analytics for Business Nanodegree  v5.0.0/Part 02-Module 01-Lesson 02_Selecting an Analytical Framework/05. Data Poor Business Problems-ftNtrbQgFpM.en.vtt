00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.670
If we don't have enough usable
data to solve the problem,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.420
then we need to set up an experiment
to help us get the data we need.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.820
An experiment in a business context is
usually referred to as an A/B test.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.270
For example, you want to know
how replacing an old product

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.200
with a similar new product
will impact sales.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.270
Since you don't have data for

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.010
sales of the new product, you don't have
data to do any modeling or prediction.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.780
To determine sales of the new product,
you can set up an experiment.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.530
You could introduce the new product
in just a few stores to help estimate

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.490
the impact on sales if you introduce
the product at all stores.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.850
Just picking any stores for
your experiment won't work very well.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.880
Therefore, it's important to
design your experiment so

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.750
you can use the results at other stores.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.650
I'll go into more detail in a course
focused entirely on A/B testing.
