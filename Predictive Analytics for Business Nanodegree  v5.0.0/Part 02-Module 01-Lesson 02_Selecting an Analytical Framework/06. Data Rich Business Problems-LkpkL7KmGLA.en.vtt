00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.740
Assuming we have enough data
to proceed with the analysis,

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.750
our next decision is to look at
the outcome we are trying to predict and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.720
determine if it's a numeric outcome or
non numeric outcome.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.535
Numeric outcomes are those where
the outcome is simply a number.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.522
Predicting the demand for electricity or

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:19.029
the hourly temperature
are both numeric outcomes.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.780
Non numeric outcomes are those where
we're to predict the category into which

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.440
a case or customer falls.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.450
Such as whether a customer will pay on
time, pay late, or default on a payment.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.000
Another example is whether or

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.650
not an electronic device
will fail before 1000 hours.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.840
We generally refer to models that
predict a non numeric outcome

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.950
as classification models.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.190
Those that predict numeric outcomes
are known as regression models.
