00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.380
The analytical problem solving
framework that we just outlined

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.160
will help us systematically work
our way through a business problem.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.600
However, it doesn't help us
understand which methodology to use.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.270
To determine the methodology, we're
going to reference the following flow

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.190
chart, which we'll refer
to as the Methodology Map.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.010
The Methodology Map will help us as
we decide which problem to use for

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.800
our business problem.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.480
And is meant to be used as we work our
way through the analytical problem

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.080
solving framework provided
in the previous lesson.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.570
Let's start at the top
of the flow chart.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.710
The first step is to determine
if the business problem

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.510
involves predicting an outcome or not.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.760
Having a solid understanding
of the business issue

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.310
and data will help us easily
answer this question.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.640
Earlier, we discussed a scenario
where we needed to predict

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.190
the electricity supply capacity.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.884
After working through the business
issue, we decided that we also need to

00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:59.180
predict the temperature of
each hour of the day as well.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.700
For this scenario,
we'd go down the path to the left.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.250
For many problems, some basic data
analysis methodologies will be enough.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.820
For these types of analysis,
we proceed down the path to the right.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.479
Let's first summarize some types
of non-predictive data analysis.
