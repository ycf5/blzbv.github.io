00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.960
Let's move on to classifications and

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.891
the modelling types that are appropriate
for non-numeric target variables.

00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:12.406
Earlier, we learn that classifications
or non numeric outcomes are those we

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:16.500
were trying to predict the category
into which a case falls.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.880
Such as whether an electronic device
will fail before a 1,000 hours or not.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.550
Another example is whether a customer
will pay on time, pay late, or

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.560
default on a payment.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.890
For example, you might classify the size
of stores into large, medium or

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.800
small categories.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.040
When modeling categorical variables,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.479
the number of possible outcomes
is an important factor.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.780
If there are only two possible
categorical outcomes, such as yes or

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.440
no, or true or false, then the variable
can be described as binary.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.050
If there are more than two possible
categorical outcomes such as small,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.300
medium, or large, or
pay on time, pay late, or

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.711
default on a payment, then the variable
can be described as non binary.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.520
The important takeaway from this
lesson is the ability to determine

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.730
if you should use
a classification model and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.430
whether it should be a binary model or
a non binary model.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.320
Ben Burkholder will lead a course
focused on classification models and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.830
will go into detail about
these types of models.
