00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.939
Now that we've covered non-predictive
data analysis, let's switch gears, and

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.210
explore methodologies for
predicting an outcome.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.330
The first step is to
investigate the data we have

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.480
available to solve the problem.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.650
This will lead to one of
two possible outcomes.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.160
We either have enough data
to solve the problem.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.350
Which we'll classify as data rich.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.610
Or we don't have enough
data to solve the problem,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.290
which we'll classify as data poor.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.710
There's a very simple way to determine
if you are data rich or data poor.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.870
You can ask yourself, do you have data
on what you're trying to predict?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.780
If so,
you can proceed down the data rich path.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.390
Otherwise, the data poor
path is your only option.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.820
What may not be clear right now is
understanding whether you have data on

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.590
what you're trying to predict.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.303
Let's use an example to illustrate and
clarify the concept.

00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:50.899
