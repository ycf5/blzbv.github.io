00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.410
Lastly, let's discuss some basic
descriptive statistics concepts.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.690
In short, descriptive statistics provide
simple summaries of a data sample.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.160
Examples could be calculating an average
GPA for applicants to a school, or

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.870
calculating the batting average of
a professional baseball player.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.320
In our electricity supply scenario,
we can use descriptive statistics to

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.990
calculate the average temperature
per hour, per day or per date.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.060
Some of the commonly used
descriptive statistics are Mean,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.785
Median, Mode, Standard Deviation and
Interquartile Range.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:40.175
Udacity has an entire course
dedicated to descriptive statistics.

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:43.065
Which I encourage you to look at if you
are unfamiliar with these terms and

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:43.665
concepts.
