00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.030
The next type of analysis
we'll discuss is aggregation.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.410
This method simply means calculating
a value across a group or

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.130
dimension and
is commonly used in data analysis.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.420
For example,
you may want to aggregate sales data for

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.180
a sales person by month, adding all
the sales closed for each month.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.190
Then, you may want to
aggregate across dimensions,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.330
such as sales by month
per sales territory.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.510
In this scenario, you could calculate
the sales per month for each sales

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.010
person, and then add the sales per month
for all salespeople in the region.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.810
Aggregation is often done in
reporting to be able to slice and

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.330
dice information, to help managers
make decision and view performance.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.080
For example, you may start with the
total sales per year during an analysis.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.340
You can refine this to sales per
quarter, then later specify a region or

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.490
a particular sales person.
