00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.268
We've broken down non-predictive data
analysis in the four categories,

00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:09.880
geospatial, segmentation,
aggregation and descriptive.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.100
Let's talk about each category.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.120
First, what is geospatial analysis?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.030
This type of analysis
uses location-based data

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.290
to help drive your conclusions.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.510
Some examples are identifying
customers by a geographic dimension,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.490
such as zip code, state, or county.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.670
Calculating the distance between
addresses and your stores, or

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.600
creating a trade area based upon your
customer locations for further analysis.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.220
Some types of geospatial analysis
require the use of special software,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.190
such as software that can convert
an address to latitude and longitude.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.600
Or software that can calculate
the drive time between two geographic

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.360
points on a map.
