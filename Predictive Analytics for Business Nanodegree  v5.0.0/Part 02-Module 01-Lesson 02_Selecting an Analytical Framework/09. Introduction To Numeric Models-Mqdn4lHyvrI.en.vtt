00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:02.190
Great job on the quiz.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.750
Now let's dive into numeric models
by introducing target variables.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.930
Since the underlying math uses
variables and equations and we're

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.420
effectively solving an equation for
a variable that represents the outcome,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.980
we'll be using target variable to
represent the outcome we're solving for.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.710
All right, so

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.315
now that we know how to determine if
the target variable is numeric or

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.920
non-numeric we need to investigate
the target variable a little further.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.330
This will help us identify
the most appropriate model.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.930
But first,
let's focus on numeric variables.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.850
At this point, we need to determine what
type of numeric variable the target is.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.760
There are three types of numeric
variables, continuous, time based, and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.060
count.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.310
The first type of variable
we'll discuss is continuous.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.799
A continuous variable is one that
can take on all values in a range.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.750
For instance, your height can be
measured down to many decimal places.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.550
We don't grow in even inch intervals.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.680
The second type of numeric
variable is a time based variable.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.510
The time based numeric variable is
one where you're trying to predict

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.620
what will happen over time.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.680
This is often related to forecasting.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.760
The third type of numeric
variable is a count variable.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.360
Count variables are numbers that
are discrete positive integers.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.465
They're called count numbers because
they're used to analyze variables that

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:28.269
you can count.

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:31.293
As modeling these types of variables
is not common in business,

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:33.590
we won't be covering this
topic in this course.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.400
Now that we know the types
of numeric variables,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.580
we can find the types of models that
are appropriate for the target variable.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.450
If the target variable is
a continuous variable,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.170
we can build continuous models
to solve the business problem.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.280
If the target variable is time based,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.928
we can do time-series analysis
to solve the business problem.

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:57.340
The important takeaway from this
lesson is the ability to determine

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.350
if you should use a numeric model, and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.680
whether it should be a continuous or
a time based model.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.640
I do want to take a moment to highlight
the fact that there are many more models

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.090
available to use, but

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.270
the focus of this course is on some
of the more commonly used models.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.270
In subsequent courses,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.080
we'll go into much more detail
about the specific models.
