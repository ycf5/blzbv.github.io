00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.305
Let's talk through some examples
of predicting numeric and

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:05.030
non-numeric outcomes.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.310
We'll use these examples
throughout the rest of the lesson.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.755
Let's use three examples,

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:13.280
a tricycle manufacturer,
a marketing organization, and a bank.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.100
For our first example, imagine that
a manufacturer wants to use historical

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.750
production data to know how many
tricycles they'll need to produce

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.280
over the next six months,
to meet expected demand.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.980
Since the outcome the manufacturer
wants to predict is a number,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.509
then the target variable is numeric.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.320
Therefore, they would use a numeric, or
regression, model to solve this problem.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.430
For our second example, Hot and
Fresh Pizza wants to use sales data from

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.780
their existing stores, and respective
demographic data around those stores,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.850
to predict how many pizzas they'll
sell at their new store location.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.101
Since the outcome that Hot and
Fresh pizza is trying to predict

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:57.050
is the number of pizzas,
then the target variable is numeric, and

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.284
they would use a numeric, or regression,
model to solve this problem.

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:02.538
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:07.010
And for our third example, a bank wants
to use historical data of their clients

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.413
to predict whether a new customer will
default on a loan, always pay on time,

00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:13.410
or sometimes pay.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.500
Since the outcome the bank is trying
to predict is a category that the new

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.390
customer will fall into, they would
use non-numeric, or classification,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.860
models to solve this problem.
