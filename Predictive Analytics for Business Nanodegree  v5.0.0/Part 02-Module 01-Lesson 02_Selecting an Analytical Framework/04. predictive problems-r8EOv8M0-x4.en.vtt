00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.059
First, imagine that your company
is launching a new product ,and

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.480
you want to predict incremental
sales for the new product.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.510
However, you don't have any data
related to the new product.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.920
This is considered a data poor scenario.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.760
That's because, as I just mentioned, you
don't have any data related to the sales

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.770
of the product to help
you predict an outcome.
