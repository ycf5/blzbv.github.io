00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.220
Looking at our TV sales XLSX, you can
see the number of toothbrushes sold

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.440
in column B will now calculate
the first difference in column C.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.420
The first difference of a time series
is a series of changes from one period

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.430
to the next.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.750
To calculate this, you take the value
in the current time period and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.320
subtract it by the value
in the previous period.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.230
This difference will provide us a look
at whether we have a constant mean and

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.970
variance overtime.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.030
Plotting the different series in
a time series plot, we can see that

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.940
the difference revolves around
the constant mean of almost zero and

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.400
has a relatively constant variance.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.170
If the first difference of the series is
unable to transform the data stationary,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.130
we would calculate the second
difference, third difference and so

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.270
on until the series is
rendered stationary.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.680
Note that the second difference is not
the difference from two periods ago,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.010
rather it is the first difference of
the first difference as calculated here.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.830
The third, fourth, fifth difference,
etc., would be calculated the same way.
