00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.580
A purely AR model forecasts our variable
using a combination of past values of

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.445
the variable.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:07.840
AR models act like linear
regression models.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.170
And the more AR terms, the more
previous periods used in the forecast.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.521
So once you've stationarized
a time series,

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.077
the next step is to determine how many
AR terms are needed to account for

00:00:18.077 --> 00:00:20.205
any autocorrelation left in the series.

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:21.842
As we just saw, the ACF and

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:27.170
PACF plots are helpful in determining
the number of AR terms to include.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.436
However, this alone cannot
lead you to the best model.

00:00:30.436 --> 00:00:33.740
These plots help you to choose a few
models to test against each other.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.230
While choosing a model manually
can be a very iterative process,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.190
modern tools like Alteryx can automate
most of this process for you.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.802
As a review from our ACF and
PACF lessons,

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:47.222
let's take a look at what
suggests AR terms in a model.

00:00:47.222 --> 00:00:50.763
The ACF plot will show
autocorrelation decaying towards 0,

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:53.770
while the PACF plot will
cut off quickly towards 0.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.692
If the ACF of a stationarized
series shows positive at Lag-1,

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:58.860
AR terms are best.
