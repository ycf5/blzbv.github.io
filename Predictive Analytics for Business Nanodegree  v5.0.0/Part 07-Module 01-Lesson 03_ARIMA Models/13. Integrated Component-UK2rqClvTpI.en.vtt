00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.590
The integrated component term refer
to the number of times we have to

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.170
difference our dataset
to make it stationary.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.780
If a series must be differenced
to be made stationary,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.420
we consider it integrated.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.689
So if we only need to take the first
difference to stationarize our series,

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.264
then the I terms will be 1.

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:19.660
Referring back to our toothbrush
example, to make it stationary,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.531
we had to difference it one time,
so the I term will be 1.

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:28.650
Putting it all together, we had 1
AR term, 0 MA terms, and 1 I term.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.234
So we denote this model as ARIMA(1,1,0).
