00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.680
Seasonal difference of a time series is
a series of changes from one season to

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.610
the next.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.670
For monthly data,
our m term would be 12.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.940
And the seasonal difference of any
period is the difference between itself

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.520
and 12 periods prior.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.554
Such as between January 2016,
and January 2015.

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:19.892
The seasonal differencing
component allows us to account for

00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:23.380
the value that was observed in
the same season one year earlier.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.980
Looking at our Bates Hotel example,
bookings spiked in both the summer and

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.070
winter, and
our seasonal model can account for

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.190
that regularly occurring pattern.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.394
Seasonal models can use non-seasonal
differencing, seasonal differencing, or

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:36.587
a combination of both.

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:37.356
Non-seasonal and

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:40.620
seasonal differencing are combined
the stationarize the series.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889
Let's take a closer look
at seasonal differencing.

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:43.794
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:48.320
We'll start by imputing our
Bookings.xlsx data into Alteryx.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.238
We can add a seasonal difference to the
end of the data set by using a multi-row

00:00:52.238 --> 00:00:53.390
formula tool.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.890
Remember, this is the difference
between the current and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.690
previous seasonal period.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.210
Since our data is monthly,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.000
the seasonal difference would be between
a given period and 12 periods earlier.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.490
Our results will show differences
between the same months of

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.770
previous years within the series.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.690
We'll take the seasonal difference
instead of the first difference because

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.878
our data is seasonal.

00:01:12.878 --> 00:01:17.270
In the multi-row formula configuration,
we'll create a new output field and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.730
call it seasonal difference,
with double as the output type.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.970
We'll set number of rows to 12.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.480
This allows us to calculate
the difference 12 periods previous.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.930
And lastly,
set values that don't exist to null.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.230
Our expression will be bookings
minus row, minus 12 bookings.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.890
Let's now take a look at the plot
of the seasonal difference.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.100
As you can see, seasonal
differencing hasn't adjusted for

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.740
the effects of seasonality.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.950
So it looks like we have to take a first
seasonal difference to correct for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.300
seasonality before the data
set is stationary.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.860
We'll attach another multi-row formula
tool to the first multi-row tool.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.345
We'll create a new field called S,
first difference.

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:03.078
And the calculation will be seasonal
difference minus row minus one seasonal

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:03.965
difference.

00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:07.955
Don't forget to set double as
the output type, and null for

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:09.702
values that don't exist.

00:02:09.702 --> 00:02:13.082
Now we can add the TS plot tool and
plot S first difference.

00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:16.542
After plotting the first
seasonal difference,

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:18.992
we can see that the series
has stationarized.

00:02:18.992 --> 00:02:20.802
We can see this through our ACF and

00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:25.302
PACF plots, as serial
correlation has now disappeared.

00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:28.532
Let's save this workflow now, as we
will need it in the upcoming lessons.
