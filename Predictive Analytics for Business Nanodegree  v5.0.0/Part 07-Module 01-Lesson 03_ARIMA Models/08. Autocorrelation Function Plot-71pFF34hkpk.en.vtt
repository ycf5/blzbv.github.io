00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.070
In order to construct an ARIMA model,
it's important to understand whether and

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.750
to what degree autocorrelation
exists in the time series.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.430
Autocorrelation refers to how correlated
a time series is with its past values.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.280
Let's quickly look at an example.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.090
The autocorrelation function plot
show a series correlated with itself,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.110
like by x time units.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.240
So if you take each of the correlation
numbers we just calculated and plotted

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.540
them, you'd have the autocorrelation
function plot or ACF plot.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.670
We use this plot to see the correlation
between the points up to, and

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.880
including our lag unit.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.480
Looking at the ACF plot
of our toothbrush series,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.030
we see the correlation coefficient
represented in the vertical axis.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.140
Or the number of lag shown
across the horizontal axis.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.030
This will let us know how far out our
time series is correlated with itself.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.030
This series is undifferenced and
has a slow decay toward 0 correlation.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.340
Meaning that the current values are much
more correlated to recent values

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.540
than values further in the past.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.890
This suggests that the series
is not stationary and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.720
will need to be differenced
to reach a stationary series.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.650
This plot is for
the same toothbrush sales data set, but

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.640
now we've taken the first difference.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700
You can see that Lag-1 is significant.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.300
However this time the significance
after Lag-1 is much less,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.950
suggesting now a stationary series.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.310
We can now use this plot to help us
determine if we should use AR, MA, or

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.420
both components.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.670
And how many lags we should use.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.440
Let's discuss a few things
about selecting AR and

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.580
MA components in an ARIMA model.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.150
Generally, the model is sufficient
with either an AR or MA term.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.069
Models that use both
terms are less common.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.330
If the stationarized series has positive
correlation at Lag-1, AR terms are best.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.810
If it has negative correlation at Lag-1,
then MA terms are best.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.020
The decay or cut off of the ACF will
give us hints at what terms to use,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.555
as well as spikes decaying towards 0.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.450
Analyzing the plot we just looked at,
we have a suggestion of an AR 1 model,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.380
because after we stationarize
the data set through differencing,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.090
there was positive autocorrelation at
Lag-1 and a spikes decay towards 0.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.810
Now these are some useful tips, but the
process of selecting the model manually

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.720
will likely involve several rounds of
differencing, reviewing plots, and

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.230
comparing models.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.120
More advanced statistical
tools like all tricks,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.780
handle this process automatically,
which we'll touch on later.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.330
Now that we've looked at possible AR and
MA terms from the ACF,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.370
we can look to the partial
autocorrelation function plot, or PACF,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.790
to better confirm our findings.
