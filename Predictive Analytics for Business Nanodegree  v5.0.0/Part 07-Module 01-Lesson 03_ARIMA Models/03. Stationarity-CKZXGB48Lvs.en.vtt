00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.590
We just heard that a time series may
need to be transformed by differencing

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.210
to be made stationary.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.850
What exactly does that mean?

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.450
Well, to begin, a stationary time
series is one where the mean and

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.918
variance are constant overtime.

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:15.280
A real model's making
adjustments in its calculation

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.260
to make the series stationary.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.690
A stationarized series is relatively
easy to predict for our models.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.410
It simply predicts that its mean and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.230
variance will be the same in the future
as they have been in the past.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.940
A stationary time series will also allow
us to obtain meaningful statistics such

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.460
as means, variances and
correlations with other variables.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.050
These statistics are only useful
descriptors if the series is stationary.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.190
For example, if a series is consistently
increasing over time, such as what

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.510
we have seen with our Bates Hotel
booking series, the sample mean and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.000
variance will grow with the size of the
sample and our forecasting models will

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.490
always underestimate the mean and
variance in the future periods.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.240
This is why we need
a stationary data set.
