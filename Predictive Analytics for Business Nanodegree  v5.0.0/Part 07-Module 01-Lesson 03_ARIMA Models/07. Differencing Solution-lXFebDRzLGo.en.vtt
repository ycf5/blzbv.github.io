00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.006
To calculate the first
difference of a time series,

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.183
we'll take any given period and
subtract it from the previous period.

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:11.736
The second difference is simply the same
calculation, only we'll be taking

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:15.190
the difference of the first difference,
rather than time series itself.
