00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.000
Seasonal ARIMA Models are used
when your time series exhibits

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.442
signs of seasonality.

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.060
They are very similar to
Non-Seasonal ARIMA Models but

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.962
we need to add a few more terms to
adjust for the seasonal component.

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:14.922
Where Non-Seasonal ARIMA Models
are generally denoted ARIMA(p,d,q)

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:19.250
with parameters p,d, and
q as the model terms.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.550
p is the number of the auto regressive,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.420
d is the degree of differencing, and
q is the number of moving average terms.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.410
Seasonal ARIMA models are usually
denoted ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.770
where m refers to a number of
Periods in each season and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.230
the upper case P, D, Q refer to
the auto regressive differencing and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.525
moving average term for
the seasonal part of the ARIMA model.

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:46.510
We'll refer back to our base hotel
example as we work through seasonal

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.070
ARIMAs
