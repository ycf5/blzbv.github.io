00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.070
The seasonal part of an ARIMA
model has the same structure as

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.590
the non-seasonal part.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.090
It may have an AR term, an MA term,
and a differencing component.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.360
Pure seasonal AR or

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.700
MA behavior is similar to the signature
of pure non-seasonal AR or MA behavior.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.617
Except that the patterns
appear in the ACF and

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.929
PACF plots that use a seasonal lag.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.358
A model that should use just AR terms
slowly decays in the ACF while the PACF

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.100
cuts off to zero.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.600
Conversely, a model that should use
just MA terms has spikes in the PACF,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.460
the decay towards zero,
while the ACF cuts off to zero.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.110
A seasonal AR model is most
appropriate when seasonal

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.310
autocorrelation is positive, whereas
a seasonal MA model is most appropriate

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.780
when seasonal
autocorrelation is negative.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.380
Let's return to our Bates' Hotel
example to see what this looks like.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.120
Let's open back up our ARMA
workflow in Alteryx and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.220
take a look at the time series plot
of the seasonal first difference.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.530
When looking for non-seasonal p and
q values in seasonally difference data,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.920
we can ignore any significance
at the seasonal lags.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.610
This will be found in our ACF and
PACF plots.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.220
This would be lag 12, 24 and so
on because we have monthly data.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.310
When finding seasonal p and q values,
we will only want to look for

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.630
significance in the seasonal lags.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.160
In the ACF and
PACF plots of the seasonal first

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.540
difference of the bookings data, we see
a significant negative lag at 12 and

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.310
cuts off to 0 at lag 24,
suggesting seasonal NA1 terms.
