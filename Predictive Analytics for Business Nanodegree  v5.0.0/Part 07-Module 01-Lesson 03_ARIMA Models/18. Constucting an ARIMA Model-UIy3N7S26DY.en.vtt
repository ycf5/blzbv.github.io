00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.280
To begin, we can open our AREMA
workflow from our differencing and

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.100
selecting AR and MA terms lessons.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.300
Now, like we did in our ETS model,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.020
we'll use a record ID to filter
out a hold out sample to start.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.740
We saw previously in our
seasonal differencing lesson that

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.290
auto correlation after
seasonally first differencing

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.900
has now lowered to a point where
we can add autoregressive and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.630
moving average terms to account for
any remaining autocorrelation.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.280
This also means our lower case d and
upper case D values will be 1 since we

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.750
took a seasonal difference and
a first difference.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.040
From the ACF plot, we saw negative
autocorrelation at Lag 1 and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.240
it is confirmed in the PACF.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.900
This suggests a lower case q value of 1.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.530
We also have significant autocorrelation
at the first seasonal period like 12.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.609
We can add an upper case Q
term of 1 to account for this.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.370
Now that we have our terms,
let's bring in an AREMA tool.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.040
We'll call the model AREMA,
set Bookings to our target variable,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.620
and set Target field
frequency to Monthly.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.200
On the Model Customization tab,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.770
let's select Completely user
specified model, and set our terms.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.514
The non-seasonal auto regressive
component, lower case p, is 0.

00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:16.358
The degree of first differencing is 1.

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:19.756
The order of the moving
average component is 1.

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:22.995
The seasonal autoregressive
component is 0.

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:25.874
The degree of seasonal
differencing is 1.

00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:29.694
And the order of the seasonal
moving average is 1.

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:32.262
On the Other options tab we
can set our start date and

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:34.250
the number of periods to forecast for.

00:01:35.388 --> 00:01:39.330
Since it is wise to construct more than
one model and compare the results, let's

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.800
copy and paste our AREMA tool on the
canvas, and change the uppercase Q to 2.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.580
We're using additional seasonal MA
terms because our time series is very

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.680
seasonal, and we want to ensure this
seasonal component is accounted for.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.522
Before we hit Run, add a browser to
the R or report node of the AREMA tools.

00:01:56.522 --> 00:01:59.530
We can click on the Play button
now to build our models.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.727
The output from our AREMA tool will
show us important measurements such as

00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:08.140
the information criteria,
in-sample error measures, and

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.733
the remaining ACF and PACF.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.264
We'll discuss how to compare,
forecast, and

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:15.200
visualize these results in lesson four.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.850
For now, save this workflow as we'll
come back to reference it later on in

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.430
the course.
