00:00:00.022 --> 00:00:03.559
A series display is moving average
behavior if it undergoes random

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:07.045
jumps whose effects are felt in two or
more consecutive periods.

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:10.827
These jumps are represented in the error
that is calculated in our ARIMA model

00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:13.118
and is what the MA()
component will lag for.

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:17.780
A purely MA() model will smooth out the
impact of sudden movements in the data,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.680
similar to simple exponential
smoothing methods.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.090
To review, indicators that we should
use MA() terms in our model are,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.490
an MA() series is usually negatively
autocorrelated at Lag-1, an ACF that

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.310
cuts off sharply after a few lags, and a
PACF that decreases out more gradually.
