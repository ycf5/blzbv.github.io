00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.450
Partial autocorrelation can
be a pretty tricky concept.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.910
It is the correlation between
two variables controlling for

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.450
the values of another set of variables.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.620
For example, if we consider three
consecutive values in a time series,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.360
they all have some amount of
correlation with each other.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.210
The correlation between
the current period and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.180
lag 2 would be autocorrelation.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.040
The same calculation,
controlling for the value of lag 1,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.960
would be partial autocorrelation.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.600
To understand more about
partial autocorrelation,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.680
see the link below the video.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.200
So while the ACF calculate
the correlations of each of the previous

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.940
points with a value, the PACF shows
the correlation of these points,

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.880
controlling for the values of
all previous lag variables.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.730
Let's take a look at the PACF plot of
our difference toothbrush dataset.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.020
Note that the PACF plot has
a significant spike only at Lag-1.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.849
This means that all autocorrelation
is effectively explained by Lag-1

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:55.880
autocorrelation.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.570
Inspecting the PACF will suggest
how many AR terms you need to use

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.770
to explain the article relation
pattern in a time series.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.030
If the partial autocorrelation
drops off at lag number k,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.860
it generally indicates an ARk Model.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.570
If it drops off more gradually,
it suggests a MA model.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.456
Looking at our example,
we see the PACF drops off after Lag-1,

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:19.862
which confirms that our
series suggest an AR-1 model.

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:22.170
Whew, did you get all that?

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.570
Let's take a look at a few examples.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.220
Let's jump over to Alteryx to take
a look at where we can find the ACF and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.880
PACF plots.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.560
We'll begin by bringing
in our TBSales.xlsx and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.365
connecting it to a TS plot tool.

00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:38.245
In the TS Plot tool configuration,

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:41.730
we'll set our target field to
toothbrush sales, the target field

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.790
frequency will be monthly, and
the plot type will be time series plot.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.600
Now, add a browse tool to
the interactive node and hit Run.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.680
At the bottom of the resulting report,
the ACF and PACF plots show the serial

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.540
correlation of the series or
how correlated it is with itself.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.550
Correlation coefficient
is on the vertical axis,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.110
while the lag value is
on the horizontal axis.
