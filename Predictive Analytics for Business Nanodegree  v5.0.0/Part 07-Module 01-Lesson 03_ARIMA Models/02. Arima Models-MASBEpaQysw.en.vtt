00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:02.000
When we put it all together,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.802
non-seasonal ARIMA models
are displayed as ARIMA p, d, q.

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:09.237
The p, d, and q values represent
the amount of periods to lag for

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:10.715
in our ARIMA calculation.

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:14.505
Basically, that means
that we said p = 2.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:18.275
We'll be using the two previous periods
of our time series in the autoregressive

00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:20.095
portion of the calculation.

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:23.385
This helps adjust the line
fitted to forecast the series.

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:26.195
Purely AR models will look
like a linear regression where

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:29.215
the predictive variables are a certain
number of previous periods

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:31.015
which is represented by p.

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:34.115
The differencing term refers to
the process we use to transform a time

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:36.210
series into a stationary one.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.080
That is a series without trend or
seasonality.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.090
This process is called differencing and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.590
the d refers to the number of
transformations used in the process.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.502
And, the moving average term refers
to the lag of the error component.

00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:52.766
As a quick reminder, the error component
refers to the part of the time series

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.008
not explained by trend or seasonality.

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:58.467
MA models look like linear regression
models where the predictive variables

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:00.180
are the previous q periods of errors.
