00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.740
In this lesson, you'll learn how to
use an ARIMA model, which stands for

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.440
Auto Regressive Integrated
Moving Average.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.940
I know, it sounds intimidating, but
we'll take it step by step, and

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.090
by the end, you'll be a pro.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.340
Your first step to becoming a pro will
be look at a process that transforms

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.030
a time series into
a more workable format.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.790
Then we'll discuss each component
of the model in detail, and

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.040
finally, we'll go through the process
to build a model and make a forecast.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.850
There are two types of ARIMA models,
non-seasonal and seasonal.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.810
We'll first discuss
non seasonal ARIMA and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.381
then move into seasonal ARIMA later on.

00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.480
Non-seasonal ARIMA
models forecast future

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.553
points based upon the construction of
three components, an autoregressive, AR,

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:44.950
a differencing, I, and
a moving average, MA, component.
