00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.170
To create a dataset, where only rows
of data exist without empty cells,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.180
we're first going to run the workflow
with just the file brought in.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.810
We can see empty values in the fields,
but

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.940
because there are blanks in the age and
income fields,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.549
I suspect that these field types are not
number field types, but strings.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.250
This is confirmed when I
click on Metadata as age and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.352
income show up as V-strings.

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:31.250
So I'll first add a select tool and
change the field types for age and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.270
income to number types.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.010
Now when the workflow is run no values
appear in the age and income fields.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.990
Now I can build a filter.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.670
The filters at the records where there
are nulls in any of these fields and

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.730
remove them from the dataset.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.010
I'll add the first filter tool and
set it to age is not null.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.750
Then I'm going to do the same for
the other fields.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.100
So I finish up with
homeowner is not null.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.070
And with these four filters,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.520
I'll be able to select out the records
where none of these fields is null.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.760
I could've also created one filter tool
for the same operation using an or

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.680
in between the is not null
expression for each field.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.280
In the end, we're left with five records
where there's a value in every field.
