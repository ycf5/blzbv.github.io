00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:04.790
There are several ways the analyst try
to identify outliers more methodically

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.340
rather than simply eyeballing them.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.050
One way is a box and whisker plot.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.070
With this visualization, we can make use
of the general rule of thumb that says

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.430
is a value is one a half times
the interquartile range of a data set,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.330
then it can be considered an outlier.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.480
Now we just threw in the mix
the term interquartile

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.410
range which may not be
familiar to all of us.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.330
So let's take a look at what
that looks like and means.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.600
Here we have a simple box and
whisker plot

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.390
that uses our same income data example
that we built out the histogram with.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.290
Let's quickly review the components
to this visualization.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.960
The line in the middle is
the median of your data.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.780
It's the mid point value when
you line up all of your data.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.150
Then we have the two lines that
identify the 1st and 3rd quartiles.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.700
Each of these are essentially
the medians of the bottom half and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.870
top half of our data.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.430
Everything in between,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.930
shown in the orange box,
falls into the interquartile range.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.670
Its value is the difference between
the third quartile value and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.760
the first quartile value.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.499
And according to our rule of thumb
definition, if a point is more than one

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.110
and a half times the interquartile
range above the third quartile or

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.620
below the first quartile,
we would consider it an outlier.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.990
To demonstrate how you
would determine whether or

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.480
not a value is an outlier, I've included
an example in the area below the video.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.830
In the case of our data, all of
the data except one point up here in

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.960
the circle stops at 100,000, so
that's where the line is drawn.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.960
But from this diagram, we can see
how our data is distributed and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.590
where the extreme values are.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
One other visualization that's
becoming more recognized

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.950
that we won't cover in detail, but we
should be aware of is the violin plot.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.760
As we can see, it has similar components
as the box and whisker plot, but

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.720
it adds in a component that shows the
volume of the distribution of the data

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.215
indicated by the the width
of the blue area.

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:18.685
I like to think of it as combining,

00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:22.385
the aspects of a histogram
with the box and whisker plot.

00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:25.105
So as to provide a more
complete view of the data.
