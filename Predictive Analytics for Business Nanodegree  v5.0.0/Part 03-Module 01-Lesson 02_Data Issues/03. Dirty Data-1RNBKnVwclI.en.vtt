00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.330
So what do we mean by dirty data?

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.770
Dirty data is data that contain
some kind of errors in them, or

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.260
are in a format that's unfriendly or
unusable.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.860
You'll need to spend
time cleaning dirty data

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.630
to make sure you get a correct
answer during your analysis.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.870
For example,
If we want to count customers, but

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.890
some of these customers are represented
in duplicate records, then we'll

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.900
need to fix this before counting them
up, or we'll get an inaccurate count.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.800
As we start digging into data, we may
come across many forms of dirty data.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.620
Think about the way that data
is captured by companies.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.460
Some of it is entered manually, and

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.550
some part of that data will always be
suspect because of, well, human error.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.530
Let's look at a few
examples of dirty data.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.330
How many times has your name
been spelled wrong on a piece of

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.930
mail you've received?

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.910
That was probably caused by a typo when
someone manually entered your name.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.280
How about when you get two
pieces of the same junk mail?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.950
That's a problem with duplicate
records for the same person.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.510
What about when you get a piece of mail
addressed to someone who used to live at

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.110
your address?

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.030
Well that's also a form of dirty data,
because it's not accurate, and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.140
that person has moved on.
