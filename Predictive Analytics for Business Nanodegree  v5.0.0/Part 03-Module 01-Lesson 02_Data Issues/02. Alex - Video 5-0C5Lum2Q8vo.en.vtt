00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
Data preparation, data cleaning,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:09.070
it's janitorial work and it's not that that's bad, but it's necessary.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.685
We have to clean the data because it's not always perfect.

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.020
What I mean by that is that sometimes you don't have validation.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.820
So, let's just say a date isn't in a standard date format,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.400
and you wanted to find the thing that was the oldest.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.570
If you don't have some kind of a cleaning process,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.160
you might miss something.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.220
So, if you put in a date say September 1st, 1980,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.750
but I type it out,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.845
I spell it out September,

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:42.590
S-E-P, how are you going to filter that?

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.400
How are you going to equate those to the same date?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.180
So, you have to cleanse it.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.270
That process of cleansing basically create

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.960
structure within the dataset so that there's a continuity,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.550
there is what we call normalization,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.200
where you know everything in there follows some set of rule.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.170
So, if a column is only going to have ones and zeros,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.770
you better not have an A or a three in there or an empty space.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.595
If there is, you have to understand it and either get rid of it.

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:14.605
Or when say cleanse,

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:17.120
we want to either get rid of it or turn it into

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.320
a real value that you can understand and measure.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.590
So, data cleansing, it's integral part at the very beginning.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.810
If you don't cleanse your data,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.390
your output and your analysis can be all wrong.
