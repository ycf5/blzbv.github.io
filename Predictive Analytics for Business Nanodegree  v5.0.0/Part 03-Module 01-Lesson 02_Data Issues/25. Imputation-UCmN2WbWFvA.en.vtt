00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.100
A second method for
dealing with missing data is to impute

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.440
new values where values
in the data are missing.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.940
Now if you're not familiar with
the term imputation, in statistics it's

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.350
the process of substituting values in
the data where the values are missing.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.748
Which basically means that when we
impute values, we are making them up.

00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:26.280
Some statisticians might not
appreciate that terminology, but

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.755
it's important to realize just what
we're doing when we impute data.

00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:36.375
We are creating fake data in order to
develop a model that makes sense and

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.345
is as close to reality as we can get it.

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:42.765
The last part of that statement
is what's most important.

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:47.750
We want to develop a model that gets
as close to reality as we can get.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.430
So let's go back to our
example dataset and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.310
see what it might mean to impute
data in our survey results.
