00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.230
Another issue we come across when
we're working with data is finding

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.300
extra characters in fields.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.030
This could be anything,
like currency symbols or number signs.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.900
We'd need to remove these before
changing between field types.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.890
For example, we might need to
change strings to number types so

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.740
we can do arithmetic.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.350
We may be working with fields with
strange symbols in them because they

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.820
come from some system that automatically
embeds these symbols in the field.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.660
The easiest way to fix
up these types of errors

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.520
is to simply get rid of the characters.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.300
In this session, we're going to look at
three different problems where we find

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.420
extra characters in fields.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.015
In the first situation,
we've got quotation marks around names,

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:46.925
which we need to remove.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:49.945
The second field has
a letter after the zip code.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:50.921
And then third,

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:54.974
a currency symbol at the beginning
of the number in the amount field.

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:56.559
