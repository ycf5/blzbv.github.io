00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.990
As we've seen in previous lessons,
data can have its issues.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.240
A perfect data set isn't typically
available in the real world.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.290
Not only do we have to get the existing
data set up so that it's usable for

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.510
analysis, but we've also seen that
sometimes there are missing data and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.060
we have to figure out
what to do with them.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.430
Either not use them or
make something up to fill these gaps.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.940
Another issue that we'll
explore in this lesson

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.530
is the fact that sometimes
certain records within the data

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.160
just don't seem to fit with
the data set as a whole.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.180
If it's numeric field there may
be numbers that seem extreme, or

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.039
way too large, or small, compared
to the other values in that field.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.880
If it's categorical data,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.650
it might have a value that only appears
once out of a large set of data.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.540
In statistics, the common term for
this kind of data is an outlier.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.110
Sometimes there can be good reasons
why this data looks weird and

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.780
sometimes it may be because
the data is just wrong.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.600
In this lesson, we're going to cover how
to recognize when outliers are present,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.950
understand how they can
affect your model and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.870
some common methods for
keeping that affect to a minimum.
