00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.880
We've explored a few simpler methods
on how to deal with missing data.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.680
Both deletion and
imputation are relatively easy to do.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.020
However, we've seen where there can
be issues with either approach.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.310
Now depending on the business analysis,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.480
we could progress to more advanced
methods to deal with missing data.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.990
And while this is beyond
the scope of the class,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.730
I'll just mention a couple that
you can explore on your own.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.250
The first is called multiple imputation.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.880
This is where you do the imputation
process multiple times

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.840
using a method that will
predict the missing values.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.350
Typically by using a regression
of other variables and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.050
then adding in some random error.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.050
With these multiple sets of data,
you create the analytical model

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.400
multiple times, and then basically
blend those models together.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.875
As we've mentioned, this is an advanced
method and is fairly sophisticated.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:59.385
But if our business question and
results could be significantly

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:04.081
off by using a simpler method,
you might want to explore this option.

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:10.245
Another advanced method is called
full information maximum likelihood.

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:12.579
Even the name is sort of intimidating,
right?

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.560
Here the missing values
aren't actually replaced, but

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.120
they're handled within
the modeling process itself.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.820
This only works for
certain types of models and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.985
will require special software
that can handle this methodology.

00:01:27.145 --> 00:01:30.485
Again, both of these are beyond
the scope of the course, but

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:32.715
I wanted to make sure
you were aware of them.

00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:36.345
