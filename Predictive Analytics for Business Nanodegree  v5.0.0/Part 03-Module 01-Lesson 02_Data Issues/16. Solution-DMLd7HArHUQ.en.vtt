00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.939
After bringing in the fuzzy data two
file, we attach a summarized tool,

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.450
select Contact, go to Add,
and choose Group by.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.478
Then we go back to Add,

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:15.910
generate a count of the records
by contact, by selecting Count.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.110
To find the records with the highest
value in the count field,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.310
we bring in the sort tool and sort on
the count field in descending order.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.290
There are a high number of records with
a null value in the contact field.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.380
But since we asked for

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.580
the name of the contact, the next record
with the most duplicates is Tim Coyle.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.175
So the right answer is Tim Coyle.
