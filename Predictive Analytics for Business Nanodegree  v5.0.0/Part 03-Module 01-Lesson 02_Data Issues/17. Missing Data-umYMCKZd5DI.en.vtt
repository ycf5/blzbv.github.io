00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.863
We rarely get a data set
that's just perfect for

00:00:02.863 --> 00:00:05.220
the analysis we're trying to do.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.300
In this section, we're going to cover
the concepts of what an analyst needs to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.930
do when faced with missing data
as they prepare their data for

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.040
an analytic process.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.440
So, early in the lesson,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.140
we saw issues revolving around
what we call dirty data.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
Another issue is that sometimes
there are data elements

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.960
that just aren't there.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.030
In this case, for

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.650
whatever reason, we're dealing with
records that have gaps in the data.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.310
Before we start going over
these concepts, though,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.620
let's take a look at what we're really
talking about when we say missing data,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.990
and some of the forms it
can take in our data sets.
