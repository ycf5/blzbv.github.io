00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.390
Why do we care about missing data?

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.320
Let's talk through a couple of points
as to why we should care about missing

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.380
data before we complete
an analysis using that data.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.380
One of the more basic reasons
we might care about missing data

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.540
is that some statistical
algorithms just won't work,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.340
if there are values
missing from the data.

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:23.760
Obviously, we can't move
forward with an analysis

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.300
if the process we're using
won't get us to the end result.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.070
So in those cases, we just have
to deal with the missing data.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.030
A second, more subtle reason is that
missing items can add BIAS to a model.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.580
Now, the term BIAS in statistics refers
to the tendency of an analysis to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.260
either over or under estimate the values
of that specific field or parameter.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.410
In other words, if BIAS is present, it
could push the model results higher or

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.330
lower, depending on how much BIAS there
is in one of the variables we're using.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.820
For example,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.460
in our hypothetical survey where one
of the questions is related to age.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.769
Many older respondents might
be hesitant to give their age.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:15.826
And if we could actually know what
the real ages of the respondents are,

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:20.716
then we would have a more accurate
picture and one of the facts we would

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:25.547
find is that the average age of
the respondents is really 44.5.

00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:29.949
But without the real data there, we
would be working with an average age of

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:34.723
40, depending what our business question
and analysis was trying to solve.

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:37.323
We would be creating downward BIAS.

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:42.023
That is BIAS towards a younger
demographic in our analytic model.

00:01:42.023 --> 00:01:43.273
This could effect our results.

00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:44.735
And more importantly,

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:49.400
the business decisions could be
made on inaccurate modeling.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.130
As a side note if you'd like more
information on the various ways

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.420
a model process can be affected by BIAS,
