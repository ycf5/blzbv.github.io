00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.110
There are some general factors to
consider when dealing with missing data

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.640
and the answers to some
of these questions might

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.840
guide us in what methodology
might be the best approach.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.230
For example, one question to consider is
just how much data is really missing?

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.180
As we saw from our example, deleting
all the records with any missing data

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.140
eliminate a full one-half
of our total data.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.800
This would obviously not
be an acceptable solution.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.960
However, what if we were working
with 10,000 observations and

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.110
had missing values in just 200 of them?

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.014
Since that means that we could
effectively keep 98% of our records

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:48.003
even after eliminating those missing
data, then in this situation,

00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:51.230
distillation method
might be appropriate.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.611
Another question to ask is how
the missing data is distributed across

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:56.526
the dataset?

00:00:56.526 --> 00:00:58.780
As we can recall from our example,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.668
we had missing data in
all of our variables.

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:05.905
Whether the majority of what's missing
is in a smaller subset of the variables

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:08.804
available will help guide us
on how to work with them.

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:12.465
An example of this
would be if we had data

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:15.295
with ten different predictor variables.

00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:19.335
If most of the missing values were
predominantly in just two of these ten,

00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:24.672
then we could deal with them on
a variable by variable basis.

00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:28.462
One question to consider would be
whether those specific variables

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:33.552
are actually significant to our
analysis and model making process.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:35.350
Referring back to our example,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.010
if home ownership wasn't readily
relevant to our business question,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.740
the fact that we have some missing data
for that variable won't really matter.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.490
And in fact,
we might want to just eliminate

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.360
that one variable entirely from
consideration for our model and

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.700
one further question that we might use
to consider our approach is whether

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.760
the variable in question with the
missing data is numeric or categorical.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.230
An example of this from our survey
sample is the education variable.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.400
It's not quite that simple to impute
since coming up with an average

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.740
education level might be
a bit more complex, so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.900
this could limit our approach.
