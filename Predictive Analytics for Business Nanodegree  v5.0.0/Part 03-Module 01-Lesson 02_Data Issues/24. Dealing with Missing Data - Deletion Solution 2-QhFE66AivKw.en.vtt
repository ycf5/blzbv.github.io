00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.810
To find how many fields have missing
values we can do a few things.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.290
Personally, my favorite thing to do when
I bring a file in, is to immediately run

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.300
the Field Summary tool on it
to see details about the data.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.630
I'll add the tool in,
add browses to it and run the workflow.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.010
If we look at the interactive output,
we can open the window

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.500
from the browser and we can
immediately see that there are missing

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.400
values across several fields,
by the red part in this line here.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.400
There are missing data in all of the
fields except for the Client ID field.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.120
If we expand, we can see more
details about the fields.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.990
To actually remove the blank
value record from the data set,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.870
we add a filter tool, and filter where
the value of contact field is not null.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.010
And then we do the same for the industry
and the average number of tickets field.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.640
And then we add one more filter tool for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.010
the last variable,
which is number of employees.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.415
We also need to make sure
that this is not null.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.850
And when we run the workflow, we see
that we have 175 records remaining.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.060
Another way to count the number of
records that come out of the tree side

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.680
is to add a tool called count records.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.508
And when we run the workflow,

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:35.518
the number of records passing
through is shown here, 175.

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:38.940
Next, we'll add the scatter
plot tools to the workflow.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.070
One for all of the data,
and the second for

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.710
the data with missing values removed.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.660
And then we'll run the results
out to Browse window, and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.970
look at the two scatter
plots side by side.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.070
In looking at the two scatter plots
side by side, we can tell that by

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.420
looking at the y axis that the slope
of the line has definitely changed.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.270
The scatter plot on the left
contains all of the data.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.210
And as you can see in the y
axis the slope goes up and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.470
over 100 number of tickets.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.780
Whereas on the right side,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.180
the scatter plot is of the data
with the missing values removed.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.110
We can roughly calculate the slope
of each line from the scatter plots.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.670
With all of the data, we can use
the points along the x axis for

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.500
200 and 100 employees.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.220
With 200 employees the average
number of tickets with

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.250
all the data is
approximately 22 tickets.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.953
With 1,000 employees, the average
number of tickets is approximately 105.

00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:49.100
The slope is equal to the change
in y divided by the change in x.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.724
The slope of the line
is approximately 105

00:02:53.724 --> 00:02:58.833
minus 20 divided by a 1,000 minus 200,

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:02.862
or 85 over 800 which is 0.11.

00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:07.471
Using the same method for the scatter
plot with the missing values removed.

00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:12.107
We can see that the average number
of tickets for 1,000 employees is

00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:17.530
approximately 40, and for 200 employees
that number is approximately 25.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:25.763
Therefore, the slope is equal to 40
minus 25 divided by 1,000 minus 200,

00:03:25.763 --> 00:03:29.733
or 15 over 800, which is 0.02.

00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:32.980
The slope of the line has
definitely decreased.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.330
Let's see if another imputation method
will be better for our analysis.
