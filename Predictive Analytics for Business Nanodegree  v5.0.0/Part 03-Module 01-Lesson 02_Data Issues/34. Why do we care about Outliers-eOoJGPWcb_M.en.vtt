00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.250
Let's take a step back here and

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.700
talk about why we even care
whether we have outliers.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.500
Remember that what we're working through
here is not just some academic exercise,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.310
but typically we're analyzing our data
to help us answer a business question.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.710
Maybe why a certain
behavior is happening or

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.350
maybe even to be able to predict
what might happen in the future.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.880
To do that we want to have our data
as close to reality as possible.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.000
And that's where the identification
of outliers comes into play.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.925
Lots of times data that is unusual or

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:37.345
extreme can be that way for
one of two reasons.

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:41.645
One, incorrect data, or two,
abnormal but correct data.

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:47.390
Data can be incorrect for any number
of reasons, from system issues

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.380
to bad data collection methods to
just plain typos when entering data.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.480
The critical thing to understand
is that this incorrect data

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.460
can mess with our answers
to our business questions,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.950
whether we're trying to explain why
something happened a certain way.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.510
Or what might happened in the future.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.050
Abnormal, but correct outliers
despite being accurate data can

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.020
also impact your analysis and you may
have to make adjustments accordingly.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.140
So by identifying those data
values that might be incorrect,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.840
we have the means to possibly
correct them if they're wrong.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.420
Or understand the exceptions
that are real.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.110
Actually, by the nature of data,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.430
we can expect to find extreme
data in almost any data.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.520
So, the fact that they are outliers,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.160
doesn't necessarily mean
they're invalid or incorrect.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.130
But we should know that they're there so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.290
we can adjust our
analysis appropriately.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.500
An example of this would be in our
income data that we just went over.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.520
Say we're trying to analyze some
behavior of our customers...

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.750
Based on their level of income.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.060
Our data shows that most of our
customers make under $100,000.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.690
So if we see in our data that there's
a single customer that makes $1 million,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.750
we might want to try to confirm
that this is truly the case.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.830
Or we might not want to consider
that customer in our analysis.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.130
Since it may skew our
thinking away from reality.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.640
This leads us to the question of
what effect outliers can have on

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.620
our analysis.
