00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.360
To calculate the mean of
the average number of tickets,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.780
we drag a Summarize
tool onto the canvas.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.470
We can use one formula to
calculate the average, and

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.100
also exclude any missing
values at the same time.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.960
And that is the AVG No Zero function.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.870
We click on the Average Number of
Tickets field in the configuration

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.440
panel, select the Add dropdown and
then select the AVG No Zero function.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.480
Next we add an Append Fields
tool onto the canvas so

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.860
we can add the new field we
calculated to every row of data.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.820
Then we connect in all the data and
select Allow All Appends at the bottom.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.580
Now that the mean of the average
number of tickets has been appended to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.810
every record in the dataset,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.070
we can now replace the records
where there is a null value

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.940
in the Average Number of Tickets,
with this new calculated field.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.192
To do this we add a Formula tool, and

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:11.998
we're going to update the field
called Average Number of Tickets.

00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:13.960
But we're going to
build in an expression,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.120
a conditional expression,
that looks where the value is null,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.750
and replaces it with that new
value that was just calculated.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.133
To do this,
we go to Functions &amp;gt; Conditional,

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.100
choose the first IF THEN ELSE condition,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.538
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:34.199
And build out the condition.

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:40.423
IF IsNull, so we go down to the test
functions, and we're looking for

00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:44.973
where the field Average Number
of Tickets is null.

00:01:44.973 --> 00:01:50.720
THEN, t becomes the field
that we just calculated.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.440
ELSE, we keep original value of
the Average Number of Tickets.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.380
When we run the workflow, we can verify
that our formula worked properly.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.680
So let's look at the results.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.800
So now there are no longer any null
values here, and you can see the value

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.780
that it took was the value of the mean
number of Average Number of Tickets.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.680
Finally, we can add a scatter
plot tool and look at the output.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.500
You configure it the same way
it was configured before, and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.190
now we can compare the scatter
plot to the original.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.160
On the left,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.620
we're looking at the original
scatter plot with all of the data.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.620
And on the right,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.240
we're looking at the scatter plot with
the data plus the imputed values.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.200
So with a quick glance,
we can see that using imputation,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.840
we obtain a slope of the line that
is very close to the original,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.970
providing us with a level of confidence
that this might be the right way

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.650
to handle the rows that are missing
the Average Number of Tickets field.
