00:00:00.453 --> 00:00:01.670
As a quick refresher,

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.050
we've been working with example
survey data that has missing values.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.680
One way to deal with these missing
values is just to eliminate

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.690
any observations that have missing data.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.609
But because of the negatives related
to that, we might want to keep all of

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.220
the observations and just try to
fill in the blanks, so to speak.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
The important thing here is
to provide the fake data so

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.090
that our model can get closer
to what's actually true.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.350
One common method is to replace
the missing values with a predefined

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.490
statistic, the mean, median, or mode.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.790
As a reminder to all of us,
the mean is the average of the values.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.540
Technically, it's where we add
up all the existing values and

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.500
divide them by the number
of values you have.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.770
The median is the midpoint
in the data values.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.390
To determine this, you basically
put all the values in order, and

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.209
than select the value that's halfway
between the first and the last values.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.120
The mode is the most
common of the data values.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.011
In other words, it's value that
occurs most often in the data set.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.681
If you remember, in one of our
previous segments we showed what

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:17.870
the real ages were for
respondents number 3 and number 9.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.972
I've gone ahead and
added in the rest of the real data for

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:22.570
the purpose of our example.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.018
If you recall in that segment,
the average, or mean,

00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:31.029
age for the known respondents was 40.

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:35.922
If we impute 40 for all the missing age
values and impute the average income for

00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:40.377
each of the missing income values,
which in this case is 60,000,

00:01:40.377 --> 00:01:44.612
we can then see the effect that it
has in comparison to using the delete

00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:47.270
method for
dealing with the missing data.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.230
Here we see a scatter
plot of the real data.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.030
The slope of the line would indicate,
in general, that as age increases so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.630
does income.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.530
But if we look at the scatter plot where
we just delete records that have missing

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.810
data, we can see that this
scatter plot of the leftover data

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.210
actually has the scope of the line
going in the wrong direction,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.130
indicating that as age
increases income goes down.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.538
And when we add in a scatter plot of
the imputed data using the averages of

00:02:20.538 --> 00:02:25.114
the existing data, we find that,
though it may not be quite accurate,

00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:30.035
it at least gets us going in the right
direction, as to the slope of the line.

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:32.798
The imputed data model isn't perfect,
but

00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:36.515
it does seem to get us closer
in this specific case.

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:39.495
Let's put we've we learn
together in the form of a quiz.
