00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.840
Let's also take a look at how
this can affect the results

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.240
on a simple set of data using age and

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.020
income as the two variables that
we could use to build out a model.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.760
To start with, we're going to create
a scatter plot that compares the age and

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.610
income in each survey response for

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.650
all the data without eliminating
any of the observations.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.420
We can reuse the workflow
we created in the quiz.

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:29.750
We'll drag a scatter plot
tool onto the canvas and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.415
configure it by setting age as the x
field and income as the y field.

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:38.075
Click on the plot elements tab and

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:42.295
deselect the smooth line option
as we don't need any smoothing.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:44.457
We just want the original
regression line.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:49.447
Attach a browse tool and then run
the workflow to create the scatter plot.

00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:54.597
When we look at the result, we can see
a scatter plot that compares age and

00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:57.007
income in each survey response for

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.247
all the data without eliminating
any of the observations.

00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:04.950
Without getting into too much
detail of the scatter plot itself,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.140
we can see the income tends
to trend up as age increases.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.793
We'll run the work flow again with the
second scatter plot added after the data

00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:19.457
set where we removed all the records
that had a null in any one of

00:01:19.457 --> 00:01:20.249
the fields.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.570
We can see that the new scatter plot
has a relationship between age and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.270
income that's fairly flat.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.740
This could obviously make a significant
difference in the model you build and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.980
give inaccurate results.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.330
Let's test our knowledge of scatter
plots and missing data with a quiz
