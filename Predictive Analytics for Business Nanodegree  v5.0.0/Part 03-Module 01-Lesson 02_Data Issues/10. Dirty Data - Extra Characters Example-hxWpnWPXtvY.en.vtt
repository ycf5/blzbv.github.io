00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.010
To remove the quotation marks
around names in the first column,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.360
we can use replace function
within the formula tool

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.050
to replace the quotation marks with no
character, thereby getting rid of them.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.740
We attach the formula tool, choose the
name field to update on the functions

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.810
tab, choose the name field to update.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.600
Open up the string functions, and
look for the replace function.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.850
We're going to double-click on it to
drop it into the expression area.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.070
The string is highlighted, and so

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.140
we're going to select the field
that we want to update.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.760
We go to variables, existing fields, and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.410
select name, double-click on it
to drop it into the expression.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.870
From here we're going to identify
the string we're looking for,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.730
which is a quotation mark.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.780
So we put that where it says target,
and we put single quotes around it.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.530
If this was any other character we
could put it in double quotes or

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.090
single quotes.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.129
Where it says replacement, we simply
put an open quote, close quote,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.670
to identify that we want to replace
it with nothing, thereby removing it.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.470
When we run Ultrix,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.400
we can now see that the quotation
marks are removed from the name field.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.275
Next we'll need to get rid of the extra
letter at the end of the zip code.

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:22.875
We can remove the extra letter
by simply taking the first five

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:26.695
characters of the zip code,
starting from the left side.

00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:29.595
This will result in us
dropping the last character

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:32.660
when there are more than five
characters in the zip code.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.270
To do this we choose the zip code field
as the output field in the functions.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.320
To do this we go back to
the formula tool, and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.040
choose the zip code field
as the output field.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.980
In the expression box,
we go to functions, string, and

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.235
we choose the left function.

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:54.850
Double-click to drop it in,
and where it says,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.650
string, we replace with
the zip code field.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.610
Where it says, LEN, which stands for
length, we type in five.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.187
When we run the workflow, now we'll see
the zip code with just five characters.

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:12.850
Lastly, we're going to
remove the currency symbol,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.740
in front of the numbers,
in the amount field.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.330
This is somewhat similar
to the first field,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.620
where we were getting rid
of the quotation marks.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.440
But in this case,
we have multiple characters to remove.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.263
We go back to the formula tool,
select the amount field,

00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:32.981
and instead of using
the replace function,

00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:36.712
we use the function called,
replace CHAR.

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:41.603
Double-click to drop it down, the string
is replaced with the amount field,

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:46.123
and the y is replaced with a list of
characters you want to replace inside of

00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:47.550
the quotation marks.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.480
To do this, we simply just list out
the characters, no need for a comma or

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.350
delimiter in between them, but

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.410
we make sure to put them
inside of quotation marks.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.750
Then, we replace the z with the value
we want to replace it with.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.030
We want them to replace with nothing.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.310
So that is represented by an open quote,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.060
close quote,
basically nothing between the quotes.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.400
We see that the currency
symbols are now removed.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.700
So this is three ways to remove extra
characters dirtying up your data.
