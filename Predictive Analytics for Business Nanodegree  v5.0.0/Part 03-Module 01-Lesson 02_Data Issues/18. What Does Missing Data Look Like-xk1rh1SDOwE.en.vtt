00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.340
Here we can see a very small data set
that could have come from a survey.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.380
We can see where each record, also known
in statistical speak as an observation,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.840
has a number assigned
to the survey taker,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.930
as well as how they responded to
various questions in the survey.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.670
For whatever reasons,
some of the records or

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.200
observations are missing some data.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.200
We can see from the data here that
they're basically just blank or

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.680
empty cells.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.470
However, depending on where the data
is coming from, maybe a database,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.030
a CSV, or Excel file, this missing
data may take on different forms.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.630
For example, if the data comes
from a CSV file, it might look

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.520
just like it does in our initial screen
where the missing data is just blank.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.690
However, if the data
comes from a database,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.110
you might actually see it
represented as a null value.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.530
That's database speak for
it doesn't know what the value is.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.849
Another way we might see missing data
represented could be as a value N/A,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.400
which typically means not
available in programs that we use.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.510
But regardless of how it appears,
we still need to deal with the fact

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.280
that we have values in our
data set that are missing.
