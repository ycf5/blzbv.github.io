00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.560
The reason we're covering dirty data is
to get you to think about what to look

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.470
for in your data sets.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.150
Then we're going to
cover how to clean or

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.590
deal with the data before
running your analytics.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.800
When I think of all the issues I've seen
with dirty data, I think of data that

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.730
isn't parsed properly, so it appears all
in one field instead of multiple fields.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.610
Extra characters in data fields
that make it difficult to

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.380
use the data readily.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.790
Because those extra characters need to
be removed before analytics can be run.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.840
Misspelled data or

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.150
typos which can easily happen
when typing data in manually.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.730
Duplicate data records which can happen
because of multiple data entries for

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.690
the same information.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.720
Incorrect data, like dates that
are from, say, January 1, 1900.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.720
This can happen when a user is working
with a system that requires a value but

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.630
none is available at the time.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.440
So the business practice may be to enter
a certain static date that sticks out so

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.530
that its noticeably long,
like January 1,1900.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.530
Data that doe not fit with
the expected pattern.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.470
For instance, we might have a field
containing email addresses.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.348
But not all of the email addresses
are in the proper format.

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:21.073
Like name@domain.

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:23.220
We could probably think of others.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.910
But for the benefit of understanding
how to recognize dirty data and

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.460
fix it, we're going to work
on these three problems.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.240
Data parsing, extra characters and
fields, and duplicate data.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.450
Let's now explore the first problem,
improperly parsed data, in more detail
