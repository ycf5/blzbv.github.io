00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.870
We're starting with the outlier
data Excel file brought in.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.370
Next, we have the scatterplot tool
setting the h field as the x field, and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.460
the income field as the y field.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.220
Then we click on plot elements tab,
and deselect the smooth line option.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.180
Finally, we'll add a browse tool to the
output of the scatterplot tool, run it,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.370
and let's see what the plot
looks like using all the data.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.035
Next, to remove outliers for
the people over 60,

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:38.307
we're going to add a filter tool and
select age less than 60.

00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:41.945
The true side of the output will filter
out the records where the age is less

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:42.539
than 60.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.140
There are 11 records
that meet that criteria.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.030
So now let's add a scatter plot tool to
the filtered data stream, and configure

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.155
it like we did before, and then add
a browse tool to see the results.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:58.695
Let's review the first
scatterplot again,

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:01.705
there are three outliers
in the scatterplot.

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:06.375
The slope is actually steeper
without the outliers, therefore,

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.745
the outliers skewed the model
in a downward direction.
