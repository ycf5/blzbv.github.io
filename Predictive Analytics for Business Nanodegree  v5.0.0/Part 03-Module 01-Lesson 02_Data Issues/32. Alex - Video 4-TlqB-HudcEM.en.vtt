00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.875
If I had the biggest impact we've had so far with introducing

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:08.105
analytics and predictive is ability to anticipate issues earlier.

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:10.700
So, in my realm with product quality,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.460
we're dealing a lot with surveys,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.820
and we get a lot of service from customers who

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.000
drive Hyundai cars and a lot of it is noise.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.065
It is separating between what's normal and what's a real issue.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:29.475
We pretty much develop the process whereby we selectively figure out what's

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:33.105
an outlier and we are able to detect those issues

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:37.130
much earlier now with automation with machine learning.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.805
We come through text and we do a lot of categorization.

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:43.820
Long story short, our engineers can fix things

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.725
quicker so that the customers in the future don't have these issues.

00:00:47.725 --> 00:00:55.405
So, our time to insight is shortened 50% and that value is extraordinary.

00:00:55.405 --> 00:01:00.035
In our realm, when you have a customer experience a problem within the 30 days,

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:02.720
that could actually make them buy another brand.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.865
So, by changing that to zero,

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.440
it's untold amount of revenue that we could be creating.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.375
It's still in its infancy stage,

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.370
but this is something that we do every day.
