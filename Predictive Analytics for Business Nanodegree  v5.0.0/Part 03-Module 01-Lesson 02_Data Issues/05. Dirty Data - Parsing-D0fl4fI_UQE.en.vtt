00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.090
Parsing is done when dividing data into
parts based on some kind of delimiter.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.710
For comma separated values file or a CSV
file, the data is delimited with commas.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.140
When opened in
an application like Excel or

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.110
Alteryx, the comma is used
to separate the fields.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.690
We might come across files that
have different delimiters though,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.940
like the pipe symbol, or a tilde symbol.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.970
Regardless of what delimiter is used,
it needs to be a character

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.900
that's not usually found in the data so
that when it's used to parse fields,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.290
it will not pull fields of
data apart unexpectedly.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.260
Now that we know a little
more about what parsing is,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.740
let's explore a few examples.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.660
In this first example, two values are
embedded in the data in one field and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.820
separated by a period.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.800
The period can be used
to delimit the data,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.630
thereby splitting the data
in to three fields.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.990
One containing the word data, the second
containing the first number, and

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.670
the third the second number.
