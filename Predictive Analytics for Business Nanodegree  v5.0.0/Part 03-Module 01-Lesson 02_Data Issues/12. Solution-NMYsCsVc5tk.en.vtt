00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.460
As I mentioned earlier, the data is
formatted in a few different ways, and

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.230
we want to make it consistent with
three numbers, a dash, three numbers,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.430
a dash, and four numbers.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.590
To do this, we can use the formula tool
but we need to do it in two steps.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.100
We first have to tackle
the symbol before the numbers and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.760
remove it entirely.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.640
To do this,
we'll use the replace function.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.265
Choose the phone field in
the output field area, and

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:30.565
select the replace function.

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:35.645
The string becomes the phone field,

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:40.630
the target becomes the open parenthesis,
in quotation marks, and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.720
we replace it with two quotation
marks with nothing in the middle.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.580
When we run Alteryx, we can see that
this has fixed the first character and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.960
removed it.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.900
Next, we need to add a second formula

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.230
to fix the character after
the first three numbers.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.060
We can use the replace C-H-A-R
formula here because we're

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.660
going to replace both the closed
parenthesis and the forward slash.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.185
And we're going to replace
these with a dash.

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:14.270
We'd select the phone as
the output field again and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.410
from the functions, replace car.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.150
The string field is the phone field.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.064
Then where it says y, we replace
this with the closed paren and

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:28.278
the forward slash in quotation marks and

00:01:28.278 --> 00:01:32.840
we replace the z with
a dash in quotation marks.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.220
And this will look for either the close
paren, or the forward slash, and

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.260
replace it with a dash.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.030
And now our data is standardized
to the proper phone number format.
