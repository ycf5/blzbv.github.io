00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.660
I'm sure you've picked up by now
that there can be all sorts of

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.120
problems with data.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.080
To build a great analytic data set,
you need to be aware of the data issues,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.460
know what to look for, and what to do.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.400
We've covered off how to fix dirty data,
such as data that needs to be parsed,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.300
extra characters removed or deduped.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.610
We've also covered a couple of
methods in dealing with missing data,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.980
like deletion and amputation.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.490
And lastly,
we looked at how to identify outliers,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.990
why it's important to understand them,
and how to deal with them.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.850
Now that we know how to clean
up our dirty, missing, and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.750
anomalous data,
it's time to move on to formatting data.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.710
In the next lesson, we'll look at
a couple of methods used to massage data

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.650
into formats required to build
out our final analytic data set.
