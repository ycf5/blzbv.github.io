00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.469
We've covered a number of approaches for

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.680
cleaning up data within a field, but
after you've completed that step,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.000
you can still have an issue
with duplicate records.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.460
Duplicate records can end up in your
dataset because of a manual mistake,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.200
where a record may have
been entered twice.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.580
Or it could be some
kind of program error,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.340
where some data was submitted twice.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.463
Just as I've mentioned earlier about
getting a piece of mail with your name

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:30.659
spelled incorrectly, have you ever
received the same piece of mail twice?

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.397
That's a costly mistake, that should
never happen, since removing duplicates

00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:38.910
from your data set or de-duping,
can be done quite easily.
