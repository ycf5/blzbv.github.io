00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.067
Now that we know how
to identify outliers,

00:00:03.067 --> 00:00:07.241
the thing we need to do as stated
earlier is check out the outlier values

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:10.302
to see if it's likely that
the data are incorrect.

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:13.230
For example, in our last sample data,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.820
if the age of one of the observations
was 299, then we would be justified

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.639
in deciding that this was some
sort of reporting or entry error.

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:27.872
Possibly the correct age was 29 and
an extra 9 was added or

00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:33.546
maybe there really was a 99-year old
student attending community college,

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:37.970
and someone mistakenly put a 2
in front of the correct value.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.270
The best course of action in
this case is to try to go back

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.870
to the original source to
determine the correct data.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.500
But if that's not possible,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.805
then the best thing to do is to
delete the record from the dataset.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.560
So, what if we don't
have an obvious error and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.940
we aren't certain whether
the data is accurate or not.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.555
If we have a situation such as
the two instances above where it could

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:07.713
be correct, but it's just abnormal,
then the analysis and

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.826
modeling process should
include that data.

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:15.345
That said, it is legitimate to
create models without the data as

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:20.031
well to compare results, but
it should be noted which models do and

00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:22.224
don't contain the outliers.

00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:26.716
Since we're talking about business
analysis, someone within the business

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:30.305
will need to make a decision as
to which model to work with, but

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:34.865
what shouldn't happen is to just drop
the outlying observations just because

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:36.680
it'll be easier to work with.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.530
On the other hand, if like in our first
example, the outlier didn't really

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.850
change the results where in our example,
the regression line retained its

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.720
original slope, then it can be
legitimate to remove that observation.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.070
Another way that analysts can work
with outliers is called truncation.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.700
This is an instance, for example, where
we know that a certain value can only be

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.090
below a given maximum and yet
a value is reported above that.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.804
It might make sense to
keep the observation and

00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:13.458
just truncate the value
down to the maximum.

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:18.899
An example of this might be if we were
analyzing training effect of this for

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:23.902
classroom and we knew that the class
could hold only a certain number

00:02:23.902 --> 00:02:28.760
of students say, 20 and
you had an observation reported 40.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.190
Here, it might make sense to
change the value to 20 rather than

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.490
eliminate the observation entirely.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.350
But keep in mind, anytime those
types of decisions are made,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.250
we should make sure it is noted
in the report of the process.
