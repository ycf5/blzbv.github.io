00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.640
Now that we understand a little
about what an outlier is,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.610
let's take a look at
one through an example.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.640
Here we have some income data
that's spread out in a histogram

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.610
to show how the values are distributed.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.010
It's apparent that most of the values
representing people's income

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.608
are within the 0 to 100,000 range.

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:25.371
But there's one value,
someone making $1 million,

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.860
that we can see out here on the right.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.870
That might fit with what we've
described as extreme or abnormal.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.990
Or a great distance from most
of the values in the data set.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.004
And if we think about it,

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:46.049
one instance of a report of $1
million income, compared to 40 other

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:51.110
values that are from zero to
100,000 is really quite abnormal.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.470
We could probably
consider this an outlier.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.330
But what if that single value was only
$200,000, and it looked like this?

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.700
It is far to the right, and
seems to be extreme, but $200,000,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.450
compared to the range of zero to
100,000, isn't quite that extreme.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.690
So is it an outlier?

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.720
It actually may not matter whether or
not we label a point as an outlier.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.680
What does matter is that we
identify extreme data points and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.140
understand how they impact our results.
