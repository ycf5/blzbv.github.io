00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
Before we calculate how much non-standard paper was sold,

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.705
let's check out the order quantities in each column of the orders table.

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:10.169
Now let's create a new column that adds poster and gloss

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.800
paper together to create a field for nonstandard paper.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.859
To do this, we'll create a new line in the query and use an arithmetic operator.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.754
You'll notice that the values in this new column are equal to the sum

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.174
of the gloss and poster quantities on a row-by-row basis.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:29.190
In the first row, 22 gloss and 24

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.550
poster sum to 46 nonstandard in this new column we've created.

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:35.604
There's a special name for this.

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:37.154
It's a derived column.

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:42.375
Derived columns can include simple arithmetic or any number of advanced calculations.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.340
What makes them special is the fact that they're not

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.665
just directly selected from the underlying data,

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:48.359
they're manipulated in some way.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.670
Rather than stick with this ugly column name,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.380
let's add something more descriptive using an alias.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.800
We can do this by adding AS to the end of the line that

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.204
produces the derived column and then giving it a name.

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:02.519
The best practice here is to use names that are clearly descriptive,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.998
follow existing conventions, and don't include capital letters or spaces.

00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:09.000
We'll use non-standard quantity.
