Imagine yourself as a digital marketing manager at Parch and Posey.

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:08.230
You want to identify web traffic that came via any Google page. There's a problem though.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.310
As you can see, the referrer URLs from Google all

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.850
have the same domain but often have a bunch of extra stuff tacked on.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.730
In order to write a filter that will capture all web traffic from

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.550
Google regardless of the stuff that's tacked onto the end,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.115
you can use the LIKE operator.

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:27.195
But first, let's see what happens if I just use an equal sign in the WHERE clause.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:31.170
As you can see, we get back zero results.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.829
Now I'll use the LIKE operator to find all rows for which

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.109
the referrer URL is similar to google but with any number of characters on either side.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.689
This is useful in any case where you have lots of

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:46.174
similar but slightly different values in a given column.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:50.500
You'll notice that the LIKE function requires the use of wildcards.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.670
So in this case, the wildcard we're using is a percent sign.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.745
These wild cards describe how the matching works.

00:00:56.744 --> 00:01:01.309
Each of these percent signs is used to represent a character or any number of characters,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.120
whatever those characters may be.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.349
So in this case, we're looking to match referrer URL for values that

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:12.524
start with a character or any number of characters then contain the text google,

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:15.120
then have any number of characters on the end.
