00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
Imagine you're a sales manager at Parch and Posey,

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.474
and you want to see how several key accounts are performing.

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:10.039
The IN function will allow you to filter data based on several possible values.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.939
So, if you only want to see information for

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.250
the Walmart and Apple accounts, here's how you do it.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.184
As with comparison operators,

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.289
IN requires single quotation marks around

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.849
non-numerical data while numerical data can be entered directly.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.095
Let's look at the actual orders associated with those accounts.

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:28.354
First, make note of the account IDs here,

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:33.509
1001 for Walmart and 1021 for Apple.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:37.945
Now we see all of the individual orders that come up for accounts 1001 and 1021,

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:39.600
and as you can see, they're all jumbled together

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.300
because there is no ORDER BY clause in the query.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.399
One thing to note here is the comma between these two values.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.179
You can put as many values as you want inside these parentheses,

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.090
but you have to put a comma in between each pair of distinct values.
