00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
For the examples in this course,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:03.542
we'll use data from Parch and Posey,

00:00:03.543 --> 00:00:07.015
a company that sells paper.

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:11.984
They have 50 sales reps spread across the United States in four regions.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:16.980
They sell three types of paper: regular, poster, and glossy.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.054
Their clients are primarily large Fortune 100 companies

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:24.739
whom they attract by advertising on Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.259
Parch and Posey is not a real company.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.400
We fabricated it and all of these data for the sake of this course.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.781
The questions you'll answer using Parch and Posey's data

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:36.839
are meant to simulate real world problems.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.730
Using SQL, we will be able to help Parch and Posey answer tricky questions like,

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.339
which of their product lines is worst performing?

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.000
Or, which of their marketing channels they should make a greater investment in?
