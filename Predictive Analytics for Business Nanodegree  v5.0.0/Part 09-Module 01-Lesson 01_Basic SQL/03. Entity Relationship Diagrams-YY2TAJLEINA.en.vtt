00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.774
One way to store data is on spreadsheets.

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:08.869
Sometimes, you need lots of spreadsheets to store data from different sources.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.274
We can visualize the relationships between these spreadsheets using an ERD,

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:18.000
which stands for Entity Relationship Diagram.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.820
This is what an ERD looks like.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
Each spreadsheet is represented on a table.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.475
At the top, you will see the name of the table,

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:31.885
and then below, each column name is listed.

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:36.719
SQL is a language used to interact with a database.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.405
It can query one table,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:44.995
or it can query across multiple tables.

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:47.774
Understanding these relationships will help you gain

00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:51.600
insights from your data faster than with other software.
