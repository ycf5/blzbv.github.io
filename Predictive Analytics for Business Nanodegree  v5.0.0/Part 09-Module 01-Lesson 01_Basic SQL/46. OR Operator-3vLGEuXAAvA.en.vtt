00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.794
Imagine yourself once again as a sales manager at Parch and Posey.

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:06.719
You've determined that another great way to expand revenue

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:09.809
is to sell new types of paper to existing customers.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.179
In order to figure out the best prospects,

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.259
you'd like to see existing customers whose orders omitted some type of paper.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.510
Orders for different types of paper are marked in

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.670
three separate columns in the Orders table.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.970
So you'll need to write a query that makes logical comparisons on each of those columns.

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:28.410
You can see that most orders are for all three types of paper.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.285
Now let's start to build in the logic to find

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.310
orders where one paper type might not have been ordered.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.950
You can do that using OR.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.800
OR is a logical operator in SQL that allows you to

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.070
select rows that satisfy either of two conditions.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.289
It works similarly to AND which selects the rows that satisfy both of two conditions.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.284
Let's build this out by first selecting

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:51.719
only orders for which standard paper was not included.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.320
You can see that this produces 825 results.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.140
Now let's add another paper type using OR.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.060
You can see that this result set is larger than the previous one.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.795
That's because we've made this filter more inclusive.

00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:06.900
It will now return results where either one of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.270
these two logical statements resolves is true.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.274
By adding one more logical statement,

00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:16.219
we'll arrive at a query that returns all orders where some type of paper was omitted.
