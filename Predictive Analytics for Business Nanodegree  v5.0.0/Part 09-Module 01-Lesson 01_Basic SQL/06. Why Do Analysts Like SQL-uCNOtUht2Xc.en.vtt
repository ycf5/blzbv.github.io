00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.353
A lot of the world's data lives in databases,

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:07.859
and most of the world's databases are accessed using structured query language,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.605
which is typically abbreviated as as SQL, or SQL.

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:14.705
It's been around since the 1970s,

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:19.074
and is the most common method of accessing data and databases today.

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:22.429
SQL has a variety of functions that allow its users to read,

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.035
manipulate, and change data.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:28.718
It's also popular for data analysis for a few reasons.

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:32.335
First, it's semantically easy to understand and learn.

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:36.230
It can be used to access large amounts of data directly where it's stored.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:39.214
You don't have to copy data into other applications to view it,

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:41.000
and you don't need to worry about your spreadsheet

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.435
program crashing because of data overload.

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:45.375
It's easy to audit and replicate.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.634
In a spreadsheet tool like Excel,

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:51.385
you have to click in to each cell to know how they're calculated.

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:56.265
With SQL, you can just read a query from top to bottom, nothing's hidden.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:02.105
Finally, SQL can run queries on multiple tables at once, across large datasets.

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:05.319
It's great for performing the types of aggregations you might

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.184
normally do in an Excel pivot table, sums,

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:10.269
counts, minimums and maximums,

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:14.844
etcetera, but Excel maxes out at just over 1 million rows.

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:18.429
With SQL, you can query across billions of rows at a time.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.910
Maybe most importantly, SQL's incredibly flexible,

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.340
especially when compared to out of the box dashboard products like Google Analytics.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.370
In Google Analytics, you might be able to answer questions like,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.740
which pages on my site receive the most traffic?

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:34.659
And where does it come from?

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.825
But you can use SQL's filtering capabilities to answer much deeper,

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:40.820
more complex questions like,

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.274
how many viewers return to my site between one and three weeks after their first visit?

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:47.600
And what typically brings them back?

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:48.890
These features make SQL one of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.560
the primary data analysis tools for both beginners and experts.
