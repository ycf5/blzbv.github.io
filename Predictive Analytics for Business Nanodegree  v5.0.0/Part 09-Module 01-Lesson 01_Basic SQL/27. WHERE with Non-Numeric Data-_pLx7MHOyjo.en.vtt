00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.599
Comparison operators can work with non-numerical data as well.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:08.125
Equals and not equal to make perfect sets.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:12.390
They allow you to select rows that match or don't match any value.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.600
Let's look at an example from Parch and Posey's accounts table which

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.739
simply lists all of their customers and tell attributes about them as you see here.

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.689
There are some important rules when using these operators.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.970
If you're using an operator with values that are non-numeric,

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.500
you'll need to put the value in single quotes.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.670
As you can see, this data set has been filtered down to

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.780
the single row that matches the condition in our WHERE clause.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.134
If we change the operator to not equals,

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:43.000
the results will show every row except the one for United Technologies.
