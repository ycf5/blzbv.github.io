00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
The SQL Language has a few different elements,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.595
the most basic of which is a statement.

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:10.114
Think of a statement as simply a piece of correctly written SQL code.

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:14.440
Statements tell the database what you'd like to do with the data.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.344
The CREATE statement for example,

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:19.234
is how you make a new table in the database.

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:24.039
The DROP TABLE statement is how you remove a table from the database.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.204
In this lesson, we'll focus on the SELECT statement,

00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:29.959
which allows you to read data and display it.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.350
SELECT statements are commonly referred to as queries.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
There are a few other types of statements that SQL understands.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:39.707
They all have different functions,

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:43.679
most of which relate to the creation and removal of data.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.715
Eventually, you'll learn how to do that,

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:48.990
but the majority of analytical work doesn't involve adding,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.310
removing, or modifying data within a database.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.000
It requires reading data and manipulating it,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but only occasionally updating the underlying source.
