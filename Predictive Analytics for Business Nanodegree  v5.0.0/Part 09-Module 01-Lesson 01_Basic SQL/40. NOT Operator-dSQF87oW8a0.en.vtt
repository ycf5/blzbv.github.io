00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.984
Imagine you're a sales manager at Parch and Posey.

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:06.665
You're considering promoting two of your top sales reps into management,

00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:09.269
but you need to figure out how you're going to divvy up all of

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.640
their accounts among the other sales reps. To do this,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.760
let's first take a look at all of Parch and Posey's accounts.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.675
You can see here that there are 351 in total.

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:25.335
Now let's look at the accounts that these two high performing sales reps are working.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:29.490
You can see here we filtered the list of accounts to just the two reps in question,

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.504
nine accounts in total.

00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:33.844
In deciding who to assign these accounts to,

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:35.399
you might also want to consider which

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.265
accounts the other sales reps are currently working.

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.530
In other words, you'd like to look at all the accounts that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.285
are not listed in this query we're looking at right now.

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:46.034
The NOT operator will allow you to do exactly this.

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:48.869
By simply typing NOT before this logical statement,

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:50.864
I can turn it into the inverse.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:52.605
You can see that in this new result set,

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:55.244
none of the accounts that were previously shown are appearing.

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:58.304
Of the 351 accounts that Parch and Posey sells to,

00:00:58.304 --> 00:01:01.435
the nine in the previous query are absent from this result set,

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.795
so we see 342 results.

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:05.370
NOT also works with LIKE,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.344
the same way it works with IN.

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:11.609
You can see here, we're looking at web traffic from Google in order to illustrate this.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.400
By adding NOT, we can look at the inverse,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
all traffic from sites other than Google.
