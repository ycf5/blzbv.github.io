If you've used Excel, you should already be familiar with tables,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.565
they're similar to spreadsheets.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.804
Tables have rows and columns just like Excel,

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:10.844
but have some more rigid rules.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.120
Database tables for instance,

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.669
are organized by column,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.399
and each column must have a unique name.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:20.504
You'll notice that some columns contain numbers,

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:22.754
while others contain text.

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:25.875
In a spreadsheet, each cell can have its own data type.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.390
But in database tables,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.899
all the data in a column must be of the same type.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.414
This makes performing analysis on database tables pretty simple.

00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:36.329
While the data type must be consistent,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.939
the database doesn't necessarily know that a number means latitude,

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.519
or that the text is a name of a company.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.820
That's why descriptive column names are important.
