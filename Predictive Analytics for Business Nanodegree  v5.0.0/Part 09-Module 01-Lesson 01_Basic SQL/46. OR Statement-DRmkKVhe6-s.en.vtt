00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.299
"OR" can be combined with other operators for using parentheses.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.279
Going back to our example where we were looking for

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.710
orders that did not contain all three types of paper,

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.870
we can make that even more targeted.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.289
The best prospects might be folks who omitted some type of paper,

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.844
and also ordered recently.

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:20.074
Let's keep our filters from that previous query,

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:25.864
but also require that the order have occurred after October 1 2016.

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:29.849
You'll notice that this time we wrap the "OR" statements in parentheses.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.700
You can think of the parentheses as turning

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.460
three logical statements into one big logical statement,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.365
that will resolve to true or false.

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:39.050
As long as one of these three statements is true,

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:43.504
the entire block in the parentheses is considered to be true.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:45.650
The next logical statement after "AND",

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.104
will also be evaluated as true or false.

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:53.119
And the query will only return rows for which the entire set of "OR" statements is true,

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.229
and the date filter is true.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.709
Looking at this first row,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.054
you can see that "occurred_at" is after October 1st 2016,

00:01:01.054 --> 00:01:02.595
and poster quantity is zero,

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:06.000
fulfilling the logical statement created by the parentheses.
