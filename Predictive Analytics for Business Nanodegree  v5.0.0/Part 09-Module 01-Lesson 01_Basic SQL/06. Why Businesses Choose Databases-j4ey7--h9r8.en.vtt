00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
Nearly all applications have a need to store data so that it can be accessed later.

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.790
Let's use Twitter as an example.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.445
Every time I write a tweet,

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:13.740
the text of my tweet needs to be stored somewhere so that all my followers can read it.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.155
Twitter stores a bunch of information about my tweet.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.589
Who the author is?

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.469
Me. The time I wrote it,

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:24.379
links to any other relevant tweets if I'm writing a reply or a re-tweet, etcetera.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:29.814
All this information is used to determine who sees my tweet and when they see it.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:31.920
This is the function databases serve.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.093
They store information so that it can be accessed later,

00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:40.090
and SQL is the language that allows analysts and others to access that information.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.330
Databases have a number of attributes that make them great for this.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.489
Most importantly, databases do a lot to check for data integrity.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.245
They can make sure that the data entered is consistent.

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:53.759
For example, if you're storing the number of children a given person has,

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.739
the database can enforce that only whole numbers be used,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.545
since you can't have half a child.

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:00.899
Databases are also really fast,

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.054
they can perform operations very quickly across

00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:06.349
very large data sets and can be optimized for extra speed.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.304
Databases are shared entities.

00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:11.210
Many people can access a database concurrently.

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.534
More importantly, all of those people will be working with the same data.

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:19.109
To facilitate this, databases have lots of administrative features like access controls.
