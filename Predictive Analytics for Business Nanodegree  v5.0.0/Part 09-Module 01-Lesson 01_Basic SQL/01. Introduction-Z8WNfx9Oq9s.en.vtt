00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Welcome to SQL for Data Analysis.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.560
I'm Derek Steer, CEO of Mode Analytics.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.124
I spent my entire career working with data.

00:00:09.124 --> 00:00:14.175
Now at Mode I'm building software for SQL based data analysis.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.625
SQL has many uses in software development.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.115
This course will touch on them so that you know what they are.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:25.035
But we'll primarily focus on the parts of SQL used in data analysis.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:26.610
You don't need to be an analyst or have

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.965
any prior experience in order to get value from this course.

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:34.320
In fact, this course is designed to be accessible to folks who work in marketing,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.255
operations, finance, or anywhere in between.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:42.035
Companies today capture tons of data and expect

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:46.380
employees in all departments to use it methodically in their decision making.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.065
There are lots of ways to do this.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.554
But ask any analysts or data scientist

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:54.060
and they'll tell you that the bulk of their work happens in SQL.
