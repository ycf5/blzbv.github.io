00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
The SQL workspace in your Udacity classroom

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.580
provides you an environment to execute SQL queries.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.699
The SQL workspace has a light blue header saying "input" at the top,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.229
and another saying "output" at the bottom.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.245
In the "input" section, you'll always see the schema shown in the left panel,

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.254
where all the tables on the database are shown.

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.760
Here, we see the tables on our Parch &amp; Posey database that

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.429
were shown in the entity relationship diagram earlier.

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.100
If you click on one of the down arrows here,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.315
you'll see all the columns in that table,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.550
and we may have to scroll down a little bit to see all of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.164
them and to see all other tables as well.

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:33.195
Clicking on the arrow again hides those columns.

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:37.299
The right section of the panel lets us type in queries.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.615
The blue "Evaluate" button lets us execute them.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.859
Oops, I made a syntax error at or near form,

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.034
that's because I misspelled it,

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:55.000
and if I change that easily,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.740
then we can re-execute the query.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:03.579
This time, I get a success message indicating that there were

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.069
no errors that occurred during the running of that query.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:09.009
Now, getting a success message doesn't mean that the query

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.070
did it exactly what I intended it for it to do though,

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.329
so I still need to look at the output at the bottom to see if I got what I wanted.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.114
I may need to scroll over further to the right to see all the columns on the output.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.739
There are some helpful features of

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:26.379
this workspace that you'll see in all Udacity workspaces.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:29.359
In the upper right, we have a history menu that allows you

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.034
to see all your previously run queries, if you have any.

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:36.319
There's also a menu button that lets you toggle

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.679
the schema panel from being visible or hidden.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.605
Another menu that lets you, in the lower left,

00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:46.790
refresh the workspace or reset data.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.605
Make sure you save any work you want before you do a reset data.

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:55.370
There's also an expand and shrink button here as well.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.910
That's how you use the SQL workspace.
