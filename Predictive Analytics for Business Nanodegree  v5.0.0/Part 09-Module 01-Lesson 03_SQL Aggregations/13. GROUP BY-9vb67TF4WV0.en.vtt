00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.365
So far, we've applied these aggregation functions across an entire table.

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:09.055
You now know how to count all the records in a given table.

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:13.450
But you might want to count records across multiple subsets of data.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.720
For example, as a sales manager,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.810
you might want to sum all of the sales of each paper type for each account.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.340
GROUP BY allows you to create segments that will

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.020
be aggregated independently of one another.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.430
In other words, GROUP BY allows you to take the sum of

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.049
data limited to each account rather than across the entire dataset.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.230
Let's work our way toward this answer by starting with the sums of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.565
the quantities of each type of paper.

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:45.680
Now, we want to create a separate set of sums for each account id.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.450
So, let's add the account id column into our Select statement.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.710
As you can see, this returns an error.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.055
As we aggregate in this query,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.195
we're effectively collapsing the number of rows returned.

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:00.180
In our previous query,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.950
we collapsed all the way down to a single row.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.950
The reason we're getting an error here,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.010
is that we've included the account id column but

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.670
this column isn't being collapsed like the columns that are being aggregated.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.790
The query isn't sure whether to sum the account

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.775
id as well or whether to make it into a grouping.

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:21.345
We have to be explicit about this.

00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:24.485
We want to tell the query to aggregate into segments

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:28.780
where each segment is one of the values in the account id column.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.860
We'll do this using the GROUP BY clause.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.655
You can see that this isn't ordered intuitively, so let's fix that.

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:43.670
The GROUP BY clause always goes between

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.330
the WHERE clause if there is one and the ORDER BY clause.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.535
Whenever there's a field in the Select statement that's not being aggregated,

00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:00.425
the query expects it to be in the GROUP BY clause.

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:02.780
A column that's not aggregated and not in

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.285
the GROUP BY will return the error we saw before.

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:11.345
This is pretty important and it's the key to correctly using GROUP BY statements.

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:13.430
Again, you should always see any columns in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.000
the select statement that are not being aggregated on in the GROUP BY statement.
