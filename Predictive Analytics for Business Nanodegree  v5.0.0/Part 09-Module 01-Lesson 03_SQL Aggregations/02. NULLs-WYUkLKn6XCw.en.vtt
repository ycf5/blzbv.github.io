00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
Before we dive into aggregation,

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:05.195
we need to cover one more concept, Nulls.

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:07.145
Null means no data.

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:09.780
It's different from a zero or a space.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.795
And there's a good reason. From a business perspective,

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:16.185
for parching Posey a zero means that no paper was sold,

00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:19.020
which could mean that a sale was attempted but not made.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.690
A null could mean no sale was even attempted.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.640
And that's a pretty meaningful difference.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.815
Those could be the result of any number of things,

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:30.300
they can be part of the data design itself or

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.295
they can simply be the result of poorly locked data.

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:35.340
Regardless, it's important to understand

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.140
what nulls mean and to know how to work with them.
