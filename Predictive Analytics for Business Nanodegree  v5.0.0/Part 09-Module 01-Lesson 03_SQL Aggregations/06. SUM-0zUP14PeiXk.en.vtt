00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.395
Imagine yourself as an operations manager at Parch and Posey.

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:05.520
You're trying to do some inventory planning,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.690
and you want to know how much of each paper type to produce.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.515
A good place to start might be to total up

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:14.600
all sales of each paper type and compare them to one another.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.995
We'll do this using SUM.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:18.730
It works similarly to COUNT,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.885
except that you'll want to specify column names rather than using star.

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:25.540
It looks like standard is more popular than

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.885
both of the non-standard paper types combined.

00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:34.993
Unlike COUNT, you can only use the SUM function on columns containing numerical values.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.865
You don't need to worry too much about the presence of nulls.

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:40.910
The SUM function will just treat nulls as zero.
