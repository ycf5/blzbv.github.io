00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.830
If we want to segment our data into even more granular chunks,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.595
we can group by multiple columns.

00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:10.259
Imagine yourself as a marketing manager at Parch &amp; Posey,

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.910
trying to understand how each account interacted with various advertising channels.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.204
Which channels are driving traffic and leading to purchases?

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:21.149
Are we investing in channels that aren't worth the cost?

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.629
How much traffic are we obtaining from each channel?

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.599
One way we might begin to look into these questions,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.835
is to count up all of the events for each channel,

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:33.655
for each account ID.

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:37.420
It looks like the really useful information here is in the events column.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.135
Let's reorder this to highlight the highest volume channels for each account.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:49.674
You'll notice that account ID comes before events in the order by clause.

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:51.227
Here in the results,

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:54.145
you can see that these are ordered first by account ID,

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:57.000
then by events within the account ID.
