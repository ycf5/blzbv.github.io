00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
The syntax for min and max is similar to SUM and COUNT.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.885
It shouldn't be surprising that the minimum for each paper type is zero.

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:12.800
Some customers only order one or two types of paper.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.515
What is surprising is that the largest single order is for poster paper,

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.220
despite the fact that it's the least popular overall.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.115
There are important implications here.

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:24.480
Even though it's not the most popular item,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.185
Parch and Posey may want to produce enough poster paper

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:30.970
to be able to fulfill pretty big orders at any given time.
