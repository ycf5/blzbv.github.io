00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
By now, you might have noticed that dates are a bit hard to work with.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:05.970
Aggregating by date fields,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.520
in particular, doesn't work in a practical way.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.936
It treats each time stamp is unique.

00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:13.635
When it would be more practical to round to the nearest day,

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.985
week, or month, and aggregate across that period.

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:21.790
Take for example, this sum of standard paper quantities by time period.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.240
You can see in the results here that this really

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.225
isn't any more useful than looking at the raw data.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:34.765
This aggregates from six 6,912 rows in the raw data down to 6,908.

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:38.005
Almost all of the data in this table are unique.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.960
Good news though, there are plenty of

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.735
special functions to make dates easier to work with.

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:45.205
But before we dig into date and time functions,

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:47.405
let's take a look at how dates are stored.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.020
If you live in the United States,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.938
you're probably used to seeing dates formatted as month-month,

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:58.700
day-day, year-year-year-year, or similar month first format.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.890
It's a non-convention compared to the rest of the world's standards.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.990
Check out the link in the instructor notes below to

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.180
see the most other places in the world follow

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.310
a day-day, month-month, year-year-year-year, format.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.180
This isn't necessarily better or worse, it's just different.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.520
Databases do it yet another way.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.110
Ordering from least to most granular part of the date,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.085
year-year-year-year, month-month, day-day.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.660
This is a very specific utility,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.860
and basis of that date sorted alphabetically are also in chronological order.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.700
In other words, date ordering is the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.225
same whether you think of them as dates or as bits of text.

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:40.310
With this example here,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.650
we can see that the year first way the databases store dates,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.465
is ideal for sorting the way we'll want to retrieve this information in the future.

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:50.795
Whether we want the most recent or oldest information,

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:56.510
day first and month first date formats sort of funny ways that don't make a ton of sense.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.970
Another benefit is the date can easily be truncated in order to group them for analysis.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.410
Take the date 2017- 04- 01 12:15:01.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.290
If we want to group that with other events that occurred on the same day,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.655
we can't do that with the date in its current format.

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:21.620
Grouping now or group by every event that occurred on April 1st,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.169
at 12:15, and 1 second.

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.600
That won't help us very much.
