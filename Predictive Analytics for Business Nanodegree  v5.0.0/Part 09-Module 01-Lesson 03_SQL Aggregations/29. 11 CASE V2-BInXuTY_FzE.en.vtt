00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.545
Imagine yourself as a marketing manager at Parch and Posey.

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:08.045
You want to compare Facebook as a marketing channel against all other channels.

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:10.695
You know Facebook is a great channel for your business but,

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:12.840
is it better than all the rest combined?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.525
Let's find out. In order to do this,

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.385
you'll need to create a derived column.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:20.685
That means you'll take data from existing columns and modify it.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:23.910
In previous lessons, we did this using arithmetic.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.710
For this application, we use

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.635
the "CASE" statement which is sequel's way of handling "IF" "then" logic.

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:35.190
The case statement is followed by at least one pair of "WHEN" and "THEN" statements.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.390
Sequel's equivalent of "IF" "THEN".

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.720
It must finish with the word "END".

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.260
As you can see, the case statement checks each row to see if

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.710
the conditional statement "channel equals Facebook" is true.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.200
If so, it results in the value "yes" being printed in the column "is_Facebook".

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.600
If not, that Rose value in the is_Facebook column is left "no".

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.790
This query makes it pretty easy to see what's happening because we've

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.485
included the case statement along with the channel column itself.

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:14.430
You can check each row to see whether channel

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.240
meets the condition "channel equals Facebook",

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.690
and then see the result in the column generated using the case statement.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.810
Now, what we'd really like this query to do is fill in those nulls with the word "no".

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.645
We can do this with the L statement which provides a way to capture values

00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:35.545
not specified in "WHEN" "THEN" statements.

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.040
If we want this new column to keep track of not just our

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.965
Facebook channel but also the direct channel,

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:45.270
we could change our case statement to use the "OR" operator.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.060
The "WHEN" statement is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.520
a logical condition similar to what you would put in a "WHERE" clause.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.720
So you can use "END like END" or any other operators you've already seen.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.420
Imagine yourself in operations at Parch and Posey.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.765
You'd like to classify orders into general groups based on

00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:11.000
order size to get even more granular about inventory planning.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.350
You can use a case statement to define a number of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.280
outcomes by including as many "WHEN" "THEN" statements as you'd like.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.740
In this example, the "WHEN" statements

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.340
will get evaluated in the order that they're written.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.995
So, if the value in the total column of a given row is 600,

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:32.265
it will produce a result of over 500.

00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:36.270
If the value in the total column is 169,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.790
the database will first check to see if the total is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.240
greater than 500 because that's the first "WHEN" statement.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.930
169 is not greater than 500,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.880
so we'll move on to evaluate the next "WHEN.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.740
This process continues until a logical "WHEN" statement evaluates to

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.843
true in which case the "THEN" statement will be recorded in the total group column.

00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:06.570
For 169, this would happen when the "WHEN" statement results in 101 to 300.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.170
While the above works, it's really best to create "WHEN" statements that don't overlap.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.300
The conditional statement "when total is greater than 500" overlaps with the statement

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.640
"when total is greater than 300" for

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.890
every value greater than 500 which is a little confusing.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.000
A better way to write the above would be to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.350
define specific groups that don't overlap with one another.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.495
You can do this by stringing together multiple conditional statements

00:03:31.495 --> 00:03:35.990
with "END" and "OR" the same way you might in a "WHERE" clause.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.220
In the final parts of this lesson,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.870
we'll take these casements just one step further by

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.820
combining them with aggregations that we looked at earlier.
