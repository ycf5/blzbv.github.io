00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.380
Let's review what we've
covered in this course.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.432
First, we discussed the strategy for
solving a business problem,

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:09.650
and stressed the importance
of understanding the problem,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.940
the analysis needed, the decisions that
would be impacted by the analysis, and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.979
the data that is needed
to support the analysis.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.990
In short, spending time up front
to understand the problem and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.140
the data available will help
ensure quality analysis.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.819
Second, we reviewed some of
the non-predictive analysis techniques.

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.780
And third, we reviewed a process to help
you understand the different types of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.320
predictive models, and used
the methodology map to help determine

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.138
which model is best suited for
a particular business problem.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:42.875
Then we returned to our
example business problem, and

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.700
followed the problem solving framework,
and the strategy for

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.670
selecting a model, while also learning
about Linear Regression along the way.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.840
Congratulations, great work and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.010
you're now ready to build
your first predictive model
