00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.590
Remember the problem solving framework?

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.020
We ran the model with two
different variables and

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.830
obtained pretty good results.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.090
Next, we combined the variables and
achieved better results.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.320
Repeating the analysis, modeling, and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.000
validation steps helped
us create a better model.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.320
The key takeaway is that you
should question your data and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.630
explore options to determine the best
model for your data and use case.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.910
We just worked through an example of
iterating through the analytical problem

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.700
solving process to
obtain the best result.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.320
Using both predictor variables,
in this example,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.230
results in a better model with
a higher level of correlation.
