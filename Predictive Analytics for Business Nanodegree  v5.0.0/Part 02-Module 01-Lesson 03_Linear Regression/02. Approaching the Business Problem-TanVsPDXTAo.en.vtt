00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.760
First, what decisions need to be made?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.850
The decision the sales manager needs to
make is, do we have enough capacity on

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.680
the support team to handle the support
tickets from the new customer?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.030
And if not, how many people do we need
to add to the support team to reach

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.220
the desired capacity?

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.770
Second, what information do we
need to inform this decision?

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.650
We need to calculate the average number
of tickets per customer, per week.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.040
We can then aggregate the average
number of tickets for

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.520
each customer, to get a total
average number of support tickets

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.189
that we predict will
be submitted per week.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.030
Once we have this information, we need
to compare the predicted average number

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.260
of tickets with the current
capacity of the support staff.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.760
Specifically, the average number of
tickets each team member can handle.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.899
Lastly, we need to determine
the right analytical approach.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.470
Let's use our methodology map
flow chart to help us determine

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.660
the types of analysis we should use to
provide the exact information needed

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.660
to inform the decision.

00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:05.090
We want to predict the average
number of tickets per week

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.090
a new customer will submit.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.300
Therefore, we're looking
to predict an outcome.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.900
That was easy.
