00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.830
First we calculate the slope of
our line using the slope function.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.688
In this case the slope is 0.1817.

00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:08.880
Meaning that for

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.850
each additional employee at a client we
will receive 0.1817 additional tickets.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.540
Second, we calculate the y-intercept
point, using the intercept function.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.520
Giving us a value of -7.546.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.485
And lastly, we calculate
the coefficient of determination or

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.740
r-squared using the RSQ function.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.370
Resulting in an r-squared
value of 0.7862.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.023
In addition, let's quickly generate
a scatter plot with a trend line and

00:00:42.023 --> 00:00:43.150
r-squared.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.413
Using Google Sheets we
calculated the linear

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:52.126
equation to be y = 0.1817x - 7.546,

00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:56.295
with an r-squared value of 0.7862.

00:00:56.295 --> 00:01:01.967
For a new client with 525 employees,
we could expect

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:06.689
0.1817 x 525 - 7.546, or 87.86 tickets per week.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.772
Which is approximates to
around 88 tickets per week.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:17.440
The r-squared value is not as
good as in the prior example, and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.080
you can see by looking at the plot that
the points are a bit more scattered.
