00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.200
Using Google Sheets,
let's determine the formula for

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.910
a line with the x and
y-values that we have.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.750
Where x is the number of employees, and
y is the average number of tickets.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.470
First, to calculate the slope of a line

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.159
we use the slope function
in Google Sheets.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.945
Note that all the functions
used in this lesson,

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:20.917
are the same as in Microsoft Excel.

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:25.321
The formula calculates
the slope of 0.1833.

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:28.200
Therefore, for
every additional employee,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.930
the average number of
tickets increases by 0.1833.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.860
Next, let's calculate the y-intercept.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.420
For this, we use the intercept function.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.121
The y-intercept is -11.055.

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:44.780
Now we know the equation of our line,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.390
y equals 0.1833x minus 11.055.
