00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.060
We followed
the Problem Solving Framework and

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.900
can now go to our manager with
the recommendation to add

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.540
four additional resources
to support our new client.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.190
We're now ready to package
the analysis for our audience.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.510
This may include creating a report or
a presentation and

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.790
is left up to the analyst.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.550
We've been able to use our data
to solve a business problem

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.220
using predictive modelling.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.480
Feels pretty good doesn't it?
