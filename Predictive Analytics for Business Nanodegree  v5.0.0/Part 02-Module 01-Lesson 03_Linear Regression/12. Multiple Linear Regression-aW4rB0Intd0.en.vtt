00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.750
We started with the simple
equation of a line, y = mx + b.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.072
Where m is the coefficient of
the variable and b is the y-intercept.

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:14.919
If you have more data that you
believe has a linear relationship

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:21.994
you can expand the equation to y =
b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 and so on.

00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:24.540
In this equation y is
still the target variable.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.965
B0 is the intercept or
the baseline value, b1, b2,

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:37.476
b3, represent the coefficients of
the variables x1, x2, x3 and so on.

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:41.976
A Linear Regression will find values for
b0, b1, b2, b3.

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:45.738
And these values represent
the relationship we observe between

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:48.740
the predictor variables and
the target variable.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.340
This model is referred to as Linear as
the expression is based on a linear

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.020
combination.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.830
An expression constructed
from a set of terms

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.870
by multiplying each term by a constant
and then adding the results.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.700
With this data set,
our equation would look like this,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.640
y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.850
Using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.260
we can calculate the values of the
coefficients and check the correlation

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.976
coefficients to see if our Multiple
Linear model is a better predictor.
