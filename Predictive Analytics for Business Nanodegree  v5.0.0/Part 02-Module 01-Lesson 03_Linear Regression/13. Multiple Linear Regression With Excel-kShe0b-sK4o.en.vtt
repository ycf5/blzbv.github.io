00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.400
Next, we're going to demonstrate
an example of multiple linear aggression

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.360
with the data set that includes
the average number of tickets,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.390
the number of employees, and
the value of the contract.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.950
For this example,
we're going to use Microsoft Excel.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.200
You can perform multiple linear
aggression in Google Sheets with

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.270
the Linest function but
Excel provides a richer output.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.974
Note that to perform this next step you
need to have the Analysis Tool Pack

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:26.900
add-in active in Microsoft Excel.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.299
To start the analysis go to the Data
menu and select Data Analysis.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.758
Highlight Regression and click OK.

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:38.990
The input y-range should be
the range of your target variable.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.016
In this case,
the average number of tickets.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:45.670
The input x-range should be the range
of data of your predictor variables,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.780
in this case, the number of employees
and the value of the contract.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.650
Clicking OK will run the model and
provide an output.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.480
We can quickly see our coefficients
of our linear equation

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.188
which results in an equation
of y = -24.2667 +

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:07.450
0.1019 x1 + 0.00067 x2,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.170
where x1 is the number of employees and
x2 is the value of the contract.
