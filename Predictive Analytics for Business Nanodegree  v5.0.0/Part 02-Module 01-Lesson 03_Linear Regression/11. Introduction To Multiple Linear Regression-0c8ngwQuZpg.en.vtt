00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.400
What if we have more data available?

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.560
Can we determine if the additional data
will result in a better prediction?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.890
We also have some data that shows
the contract value per client against

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.460
the average number of tickets.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.560
Using Google Sheets, we can plot
the data with a linear equation and

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.210
a value for r squared.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.377
In this case, we have a linear equation
with an r squared value of 0.785.

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:27.790
This new data is similar to the original
data when comparing values of r squared.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.570
But what if we could use both sets of
data to develop a better predictor?

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.180
Let's introduce multiple linear
regression, which builds upon the simple

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.330
linear regression by using more data to
strengthen the correlation coefficient
