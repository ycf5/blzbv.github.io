00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.280
Now that we have our approach in mind,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.270
as we start to work on the problem,
we need to prepare our data.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.580
This generally involves gathering,
cleansing, formatting, blending, and

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.400
sampling the data.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.410
In this lesson, we're going to start
with a data set that doesn't need any

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.229
work and is ready for analysis.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.010
We'll spend an entire course
learning about data preparation,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.375
so we'll skip it here.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.467
Now that we have our data ready,
the next step in the problem solving

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.640
framework is to perform the analysis and
develop a model.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.250
We mentioned that we're going to
use a Linear Regression model for

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.260
this problem.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.490
But first,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.400
let's learn a little about Linear
Regression before we create the model.
