00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.360
We've talked through the analytical
problem solving framework and

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.540
then covered strategies for identifying
the appropriate type of analysis or

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.370
predictive model to use
with the methodology map.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.250
Let's put what we've
learned into action and

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.280
use the problem solving framework and
the methodology map together to

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.740
solve the business problem we mentioned
at the beginning of this course.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.020
For a quick refresher,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.840
your manager has tasked you with
the following business problem.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.540
We're onboarding a new client next
month as part of a very large deal.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.430
It's critical that we support them
with our excellent service levels.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.850
I need to know how many tickets per
week, on average, we can expect from

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.540
this new client so we can ensure we have
enough help desk resources in place.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.610
So let's tackle this problem.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.840
This time, we're going to let you
start the problem solving process with

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.920
a couple of quizzes to
demonstrate your understanding.
