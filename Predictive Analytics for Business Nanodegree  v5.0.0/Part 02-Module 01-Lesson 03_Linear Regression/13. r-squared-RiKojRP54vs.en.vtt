00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.350
We also see the value for
R squared, which is 0.877,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.720
as well as an adjusted R
squared value of 0.863.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.800
The adjusted R squared value should be
used with multiple linear repressions

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.870
due to a phenomenon that occurs
when adding additional variables to

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.800
the model.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.670
In a nutshell,
the more variables that are included,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.690
the higher the R squared value will be,
even if there is no relationship between

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.390
the additional variables and
the target variable.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.670
Therefore, we use
the adjusted R squared value.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.240
For more information
on adjusted R squared,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.480
