00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.960
Is this a data rich or
data poor problem?

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.430
Let's recall the difference
between data rich and data poor.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.020
If we have past data on the variable
we're trying to predict,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.960
then we're data rich.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.610
Otherwise, we're data poor.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.570
To determine whether we're data rich or

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.420
poor we need to look at our data
to get a better understanding.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.350
Looking at our data set,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.640
we see that we have the following
information on each client.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.070
The average number of tickets
each client submits per week,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.970
the number of employees per client, the
value of the contract with each client,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.150
and the industry of each client.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.470
Since we have the number of tickets for
each client, or data rich.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.320
Moving down the flow chart,
next we need to determine if we should

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.830
use a numeric model, or
classification model.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.161
Our target outcome that we're trying
to predict is the number indicating

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:57.088
the average number of tickets
we can expect per client.

00:00:57.088 --> 00:00:59.396
Therefore we should use a numeric model.

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:04.690
Now we're getting closer to
determining which model to use.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.280
But first we need to
determine if a continuous or

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.550
time based model is appropriate for
our problem.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.270
We're looking for an average per week.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.170
So at first glance we might think
this is a time based problem.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.850
If we were looking to forecast
a specific number per calendar week for

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.480
a period of weeks, we'd be correct.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.630
However, in this problem,
we just want an average per week and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.480
are not interested in
the specific calendar week.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.640
Therefore, we'll use a continuous
model to solve our problem.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.760
For our first model,
let's focus on linear regression.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.850
We'll cover the others later.
