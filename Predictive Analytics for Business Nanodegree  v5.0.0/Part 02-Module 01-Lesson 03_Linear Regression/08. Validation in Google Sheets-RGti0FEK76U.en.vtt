00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.160
We can square r, or just use
a function in Google Sheets, RSQ,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.000
to calculate the value of r squared.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.650
Squaring the value of r
gives us a value of 0.9744.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.885
Remember, the closer the data
points are to the line,

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:17.685
the closer the value of
r squared will be to 1.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:21.395
If the value's closer to 0,
then the correlation is weak.

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:25.375
In our example, the equation of the line
is a great representation of the data,

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:28.925
and can be used to predict average
values for the number of tickets.

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:35.215
If we had a new customer with 600
employees, we could estimate the average

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:42.500
number of tickets as y = 0.1833(600)-
11.0548, which equals 98.92, or

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.880
approximately 100 tickets
per week on average.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.380
We just created our first simple
predictive model using linear regression

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.460
and validated the result.
