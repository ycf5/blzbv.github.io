00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.150
Now, let's run the model
by clicking the green arrow

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.190
located above the tool palette.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.400
When Alteryx finishes
running the workflow,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.710
click the OK button to see the results.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.190
Click on the browse tool to
see the configuration panel,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.935
which will show the output
report of the linear regression.

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:19.485
To open the report in a new window,
click on the drop down menu at the top

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:24.085
of the configuration panel, and
select New Window (All Records).

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:25.737
Now we can easily read
the report in detail.

00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:28.347
The second table down,

00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:33.056
labeled coefficients, has the values
that correspond with the B0, B1, and

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:36.357
B2 variables in the standard
equation we just showed.

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:39.177
These are listed in
the column labeled estimates.

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:41.137
The intercept is the value of B0,

00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:44.827
and the rest of the coefficients have
the labels of the actual variables

00:00:44.827 --> 00:00:47.017
that we will need to match
up with the coefficients.
