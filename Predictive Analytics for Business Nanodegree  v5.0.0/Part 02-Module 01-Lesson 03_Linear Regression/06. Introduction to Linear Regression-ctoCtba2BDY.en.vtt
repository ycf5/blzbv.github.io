00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.650
Imagine we have the data
displayed in the scatter plot.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.220
It appears that we have a linear
relationship between the number of

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.910
employees and the number of tickets.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.740
The relationship appears to
be linear since it seems like

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.450
we can draw a straight
line through the data.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.040
If we know the equation of the line,
we can predict values for

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.880
tickets, given a certain
number of employees.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.050
The simple equation for
a line is y = mx + b,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.680
where m is the slope of the line and
b is the y-intercept point.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.880
In our example,
y is the average number of tickets and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.720
can be referred to as
the target variable.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.220
So this is the variable
we're trying to predict.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.780
x, or the number of employees,
is the predictor variable, since we're

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.540
trying to predict the number of tickets
based upon the number of employees.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.570
To determine the equation of the line,
we need to calculate the slope and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.230
the y-intercept.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.100
With the equation, we can draw
a straight line through our data.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.560
In this example,
we'll use Google Sheets, but

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.170
the same functionality
exists in Microsoft Excel.
