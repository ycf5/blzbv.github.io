00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.469
let's take a moment to revisit
the problem solving framework that we

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:04.040
started with.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.100
Now that we've performed
the analysis and

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.820
run the linear regression model, we need
to validate the results of the model.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.940
In other words, is there a way to
measure how good the model is?

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.130
Or in this case,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.340
is the linear expression we
calculated a good fit of our data?

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.230
Using the CORREL function, we can
calculate the correlation coefficient

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.235
of the data set, or the variable r.

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:32.075
The range of r is from -1 to +1.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:37.355
The closer r is to +1 or -1,
the better correlation between x and y.

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:41.745
To learn more about
correlation coefficients,

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.195
see the link in the resources below.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.395
In our example, the value of r is 0.987,
indicating a strong correlation.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.450
While strong correlation is good,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.140
we really want to know how
well the data fits our line.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.040
Fortunately, we can get a sense of how
good the formula is at approximating

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.100
the data by calculating the coefficient
of the determination or R squared.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.524
R squared is the coefficient
between 0 and 1.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.590
R squared is interpreted as the percent
of variance in observations

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.010
that is explained by the model.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.390
An r squared value close to one would
mean that nearly all variance in

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.490
the target variable is
explained by the model.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.040
An r squared value close to
zero would mean that nearly

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.470
none of the variance in the target
variable is explained by the model.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.850
An r squared value greater than 0.7
is considered to be a strong model.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.770
In practice, an r squared value of 0.5
or greater is usually pretty good.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.590
An r squared less than 0.3 is
generally agreed to not be useful.
