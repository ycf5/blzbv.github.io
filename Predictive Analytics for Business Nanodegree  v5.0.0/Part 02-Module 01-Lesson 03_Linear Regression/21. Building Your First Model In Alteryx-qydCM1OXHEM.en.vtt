00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.050
If you have not already done so,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.530
please download the linear
example data Excel file.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.510
Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets
are not able to easily handle categories

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.930
with linear aggression, so we're going
to use a more sophisticated software

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.990
program called Alteryx for this example
and much of the future courses.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.550
There's a brief overview
of Alteryx below the video.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.260
Note, there are techniques
that you can use to leverage

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.760
spreadsheets to handle categories
with linear regression, but

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.290
we won't review these
techniques in this course.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.980
First let's open up Alteryx.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.700
Now drag an input data tool from
the tool bar onto the canvas.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.480
Click on the drop down arrow
in the configuration panel and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.550
select File Browse.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
Navigate to where you saved the linear
example data Excel file, and select it.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720
And then select Open.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.930
Since the data is coming
from an Excel document,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.190
a window will pop up asking you to
choose the sheet that you want to read.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.220
In this case there's only
one sheet labeled Data.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.750
Select Data and
then click the OK button.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.610
Note, if you have the document open in
Excel, you'll get an error in Alteryx

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.920
saying that the document is
already in use by another process.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.290
You'll need to close the document in
Excel before you open it in Alteryx.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.250
If you click on the input tool, you'll
see the configuration in that window on

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.190
the left side of the screen along
with the preview of the data.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.170
Now that we have the data selected
to be brought into Alteryx,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.110
we can grab a linear regression tool
from the predictive tools category and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.490
drag it into the canvas next
to the input data tool.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.070
In the configuration panel,
we can set up a linear regression.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.440
Working our way down the configuration
steps, let's name our model.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.780
I'm going to name mine ExampleReg.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.100
Now select the drop down that is
labeled select the target variable.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.920
This will list all the variables that
could be the target variable for

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.570
the linear regression
in alphabetical order.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.430
Remember that a linear regression has
to have a numeric target variable, so

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.570
only number fields will be
displayed in this list.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.070
Select the column called
Average Number of Tickets,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.670
because this is the variable
we're looking to predict.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.140
In the next box, which is labelled
select the predictor variables,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.800
there are a list of variables
that could be used as predictor

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.550
variables in the analysis,
with a check box next to each of them.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.830
To include a variable as a predictor
variable in the analysis,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.020
simply select the check
box next to the variable.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.840
Select the variable's number of
employees, value of contract, and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.250
industry.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.070
There are two additional check
boxes in the tool configuration.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.990
We're not going to check these options.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.260
For more information see
the section below the video for

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.920
additional materials.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.534
Now that the model is set up,

00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:38.516
let's add a browse tool to the r
output of the linear regression tool.

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:41.314
Right-click on the linear
regression tool and select,

00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:43.020
add browse after reports.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.647
This will produce a report that we can
read and assess how good the model is.

00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:48.389
