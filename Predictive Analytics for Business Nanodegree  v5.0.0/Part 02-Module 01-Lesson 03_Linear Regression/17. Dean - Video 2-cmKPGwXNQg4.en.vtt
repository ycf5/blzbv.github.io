00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Alteryx provides a platform for a line of business analyst that

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.050
allows them to ingest any kind of data: big data,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.290
little data, structured, unstructured,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.019
data that's in the cloud or on the ground.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.845
It then allows them to standardize, normalize,

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:19.465
create the perfect analytic data set and then to

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:22.080
prosecute analytics across a wide array of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.060
analytic capabilities from arithmetic to algorithmic,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.955
to predictive, to spatial.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:33.870
And then, the ability in the single platform and in platform,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.390
the ability to share the output in metaphors that people can understand.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.270
Maybe it's to a Tableau dashboard as part of the Udacity nano degree,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.260
to power BI or the Qlik or to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.060
back the spreadsheets or back to an enterprise data warehouse.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.285
But it is a single platform that gets analysts their life back,

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:56.785
makes them want to enjoy their job again.

00:00:56.785 --> 00:01:02.210
So, one of the challenges we see in business today is that we're living in

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.010
this data hungry world where people are asking more questions of more content.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.130
We did a study last year and we asked the question,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.655
how many datasets does an analyst typically need access to

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:19.265
get to any analytic outcome irrespective of use case or vertical industry?

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:20.880
And what we found was pretty astonishing,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.385
62% of all analysts needed,

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:28.260
no less than five different data sets and as many as 15 or more data sets,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.140
to get to any analytic outcome.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.300
And so Alteryx allows the ingestion of

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.620
this disparate data to be done in a very easy to use platform,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.210
without writing a stitch of code,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.150
without writing a single CSQL statement and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.105
without having to live in Excel hell writing complex view lookups.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:50.570
We also uncovered some interesting statistics in just the last few weeks.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.210
We did a study to determine the size of the problem

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.155
around line of business analyst living in Excel hell.

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:02.400
We determined that there's 21 million disenfranchised data analysts

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.790
who do the thankless task of data managing each and every day.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.780
In fact, the problem is enormous one.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.615
It's a $60 billion problem,

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:14.880
where the average analyst spends 26 hours out of their 40 hour work week,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.613
doing the thankless task of prepping data and blending data inside of Excel,

00:02:20.613 --> 00:02:22.980
a tool that was never intended to do

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.700
these kinds of things based on the scale of data today.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.490
So Alteryx is that perfect process to take

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.155
the analyst out of that complex data managing world and as a result,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:35.915
they get all of their time back.

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:40.370
And when they go through a class like Predictive Analytics for Business through Udacity,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.140
we can amplify human intelligence,

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.160
so that this 26 hours can now be used to ask more important questions,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.000
more relevant questions to drive the business forward.
