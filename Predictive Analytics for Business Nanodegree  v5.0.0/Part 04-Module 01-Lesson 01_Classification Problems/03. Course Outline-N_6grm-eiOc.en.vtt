00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.800
Here's a data analyst diagram we
will use to help orient ourselves.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.219
This will help us better understand
where we are, and where we'd like to go.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.940
First, let's pretend
we're trying to predict

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.170
which items will sell the most
depending on what the weather is like.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.970
We'll also say we have a lot of data
about the sales patterns of our

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.490
products.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.670
So for this example,
where are we on this chart?

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.460
We know we have a business problem where
we're trying to predict an outcome.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.589
That rules out needing
to do any data analysis.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.769
What we also know, is we have lots of
data, so we can call it data rich.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.410
Now we are divided between two sections,
numeric and classification.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.923
We're working with weather, so we need
to decide if that is a numeric or

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.392
non-numeric variable.

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:54.590
Since we need to categorize
the weather by sun, rain or

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.650
anything else, this makes it
a category which is non-numeric.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.890
This puts us on the classification path.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.510
And in this course,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.450
we'll learn what is going on within
this classification section.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.600
To do this, we divided
the lesson into four sections.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.520
In the first section,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.600
we're going to learn what this
whole classification thing means.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.090
We're also going to start
to prepare data for

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.480
the various types of models
taught throughout the course.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.240
In the second section,
we're going to compare binary models

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.560
against each other to determine
which model to use for prediction.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.390
We are also going to be building
out this prediction model.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:41.265
In the third section,
we're going to do exactly the same thing

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:46.575
as in the second section, but in the
context of predicting non-binary data.

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:50.845
And finally, we're going to give you
a classification business problem.

00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:54.804
You will work with some data and let
you loose using the techniques you've

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:59.445
learned throughout this course to
present and explain the model you chose.

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:01.785
We've got a lot of work to do,
so let's begin!
