00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.310
Here's a list of different
classification problems that I

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.800
came up with.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.410
It can be found in business
such as when an email comes in

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.470
classify it as spam or inbox.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.500
Or, is a customer going to
renew a cell phone contract?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.820
Classification problems can also be
seen in scientific use cases such as,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.020
What land cover type is a pixel
from a satellite image?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.560
Or, does a soy bean have a disease or
not?

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.860
Classification problems are also all
around us in real world situations.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.340
Like, what color shirt looks best on me?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.330
Or as well, what type of transportation
will employees use to go to work?

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.380
Now looking at this list, you will see
that there are classification problems

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.200
throughout business, scientific,
and real-world applications.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.170
But if we look at each of the
classification scenarios more in-depth,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.720
we can group them into two buckets,
binary and non-binary.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.493
Binary variables are those
that have two groups and

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:09.280
non-binary variables have
more than two groups.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.450
For example, in the question,
if a soybean has a disease or not,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.310
there are two options.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.330
Yes, the soybean has a disease, or no,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.860
the soybean does not have a disease so
this is a binary classification problem.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.800
Now in the next exercise,
it is your turn,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.300
to identify the binary classification
problems versus the non-binary problems.
