00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.060
A binary variable is one that has
a yes or a no, a 1 or a 0 or a true or

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.720
false type of value associated with it.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.870
Therefore, those binary
problems would be

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.810
identifying if an email is spam or not.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.190
On the other hand, non-binary variables
are one's that are categorical.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.560
Meaning there are values
that take on names, or

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.930
labels such as red, green, blue,
or small, medium and large.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.470
The non binary problems would be,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.980
what land cover type is a pixel
from a satellite image?

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.020
As well as,
what color shirt looks best on me?

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.680
When looking at the land
cover classification problem,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.870
there are typically more than two land
cover types, such as grass, trees,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.150
agriculture, water, urban, etc.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.510
We can claim this as non binary then.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.520
But for the shirt problem, there are
obviously more than two colors we can

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.390
choose from making this
a non-binary problem.
