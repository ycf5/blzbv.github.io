Hi, my name is Ben Burkholder, and I'm
a solutions engineer over at Alteryx.

00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:07.651
I have a background in
satellite remote sensing,

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:11.130
where I use classification to assign
pixels to various land cover types.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.940
Now imagine how powerful it'd be to
able to predict how likely a customer is

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.570
to renew their contract.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.830
Whether a customer is
going to default on a loan.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.480
Or which product a perspective
customer is going to buy.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.120
Classification models allow
you to make those predictions.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.920
In this course,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.740
you will learn how to answer these
types of questions using these models.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.220
You'll also learn how to create and

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.970
compare models in order to determine
which model to use for your prediction.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.080
Now let's go ahead and get started.
