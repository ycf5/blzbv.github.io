00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.320
Validating this solution
from external data

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.129
is best done by using data that wasn't
necessarily used as variables to create

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.310
the clusters during
the modeling process.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.530
An example of this could be where you're
segmenting customers in a retail chain.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.879
One of the variables used to
make the cluster solution

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.978
could be a demographic related to
the number of children in a household.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.190
You could then externally
validate this segmentation

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.800
by checking to see if
the buying behavior for

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.950
that segment is evident in the purchase
of toys or children's clothing.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.689
What you might do in this case is
create statistics around the segments.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.159
You could take the total sales
in toys for each customer and

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.029
each segment, and
calculate the average or

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.629
median spend, and then compare
the segments by those statistics.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.450
If the clustering process makes sense,
the average spend for

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.530
a segment representing families with
small children should be much higher.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.570
Many times this can best be communicated
with visualizations around the data

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:11.989
where you have the cluster groups
identified uniquely in the display.

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.709
And then you can see if there are
differences in the values you are using

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.509
for validation.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.290
Let's take a look at what
this might look like.
