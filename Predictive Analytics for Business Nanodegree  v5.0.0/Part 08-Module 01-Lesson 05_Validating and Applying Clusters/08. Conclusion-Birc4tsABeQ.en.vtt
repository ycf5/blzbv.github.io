00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.029
This concludes our course on
segmentation and clustering.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.500
Through it,
we have seen why clustering is so

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.300
different from just grouping objects
based on a couple of variables.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.390
We have reviewed the current
different methods for clustering, and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.149
have drilled into one of those methods.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:21.029
And finally, we have seen how to
validate the results for clustering.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.020
Now as a reminder, the exercise
we've gone through in this course is

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.600
related to a retail
oriented business problem.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.189
But clustering and segmentation is
intended to work in any industry.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:38.500
So always remember that if you have a
problem where you have a large number of

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.609
objects and you'd like to treat them
more individually, putting them

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.840
into segments and using clustering
to do that can be a good way to go.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.330
Thank you for

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.530
taking the time to explore the facets
of this form of business analytics.
