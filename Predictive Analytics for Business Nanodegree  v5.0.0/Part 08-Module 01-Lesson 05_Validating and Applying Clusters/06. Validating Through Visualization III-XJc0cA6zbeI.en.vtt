00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.509
Even with our limited climate data,
we can drill in a little bit more

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.349
to help confirm further
what we are already seeing.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.289
If you remember, the climate metrics
of snow, rain, temperature, and

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.899
precipitation, were consolidated
in just a few variables

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.789
when we did the principal
components analysis.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.939
For example, for snow,
we ended up using just two variables

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.710
that included over 97%
of the total variants.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.289
So let's take a look at some of
the individual metrics of snow

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.519
to see if that will further
validate our clustering solution.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.300
In other words,
what do the individual months look like?

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.689
Let's open up a new sheet in tab below.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:49.799
We build this the same way as the
growing season length chart that we just

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.789
did, but we can compare a few
months on the same chart.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.390
Let's pick November, January, and April.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.329
The idea here is to see if there might
be some sort of differentiation.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.849
And so the reason I'm picking these
three months is to see if there's

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:11.039
a distinction between
the segments with early snow,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.250
in November, late snow,
which could be in April, and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.819
normal snow,
which would be represented by January.

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:25.769
If you recall, clusters 4, 5, and 10,
all have the shortest growing season.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:31.489
But by examining this data, we can begin
to see some nuances and that it appears

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:37.518
that cluster five actually has
the heaviest amount of snow in January.

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:42.140
But cluster 4 seems to have
snow occur earlier, and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.189
cluster 10 seems to have
snow a little later.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.079
It's not necessarily a huge difference,
but if you think back to our business

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.879
case of trying to cluster the stores
by climate in order to determine what

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:01.640
seasonal product should be available
in specific stores and specific times.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.439
This kind of visualization, and

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.590
the data behind it, could be
beneficial in making those decisions.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.120
So it looks like, in our case,
the cluster solution makes sense and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.610
could easily be put into effect.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.950
For instance, you could take the maximum
date for the last winter freeze,

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:25.139
and the minimum date for the first
winter freeze within each cluster, and

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.099
use it to determine when to start and

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.159
stop stocking stores
with seasonal flowers.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.919
I created something like this in
Alteryx that you can easily replicate.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.599
I've taken the data that we were
using for the visualizations.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.609
I dropped in a summary tool to where
we're grouping by the cluster.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.041
And we're taking the maximum
last winter freeze date and

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.810
the minimum first winter freeze date.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.840
I'm sorting it by maximum
date last winter freeze, and

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.810
now we can look at the results.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.840
And we can see that there is quite
a distinction between cluster 1,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.450
which as you recall, has the shortest
growing season in cluster 5,

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:11.679
4, and 10 which have the shortest ones.
