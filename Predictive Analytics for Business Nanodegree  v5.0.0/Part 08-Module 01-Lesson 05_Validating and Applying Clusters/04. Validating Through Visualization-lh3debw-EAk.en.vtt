00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.960
You can download the data set
that represents a possible

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.349
clustering solution for

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:09.640
our store by climate analysis, by using
the links in the instructor notes.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.510
It's a file called data with cluster ID.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.350
It is basically the data file
of the original data, but

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.570
now with the cluster numbers assigned
to each store in a CSV format.

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:27.199
I brought that data into Tableau, which
will make it easy to build out some

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.489
visualizations to see whether our
solution seems to make sense.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.280
The first thing I want to do is convert
the cluster over to a dimension,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.469
because it really is a dimension and
not a measure.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.109
Since we are dealing with climate and

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.820
weather, the first thing that could make
sense would be to see if the clusters

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.939
look different when
looking at them on a map.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.329
We can make use of the latitude,
longitude values by selecting them for

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.048
column and row dimensions.

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:57.173
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:57.173 --> 00:01:01.560
Make sure you select the actual
latitude and longitude values and

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.960
not the ones generated by Tableau.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.209
Also remember to uncheck
the aggregate measures.

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:14.149
Now we want to add in the clusters and
let Tableau assign a random color,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.890
to each one so we can visually see the
distinction and where they are located.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.837
We do this by dragging the cluster
ID into the color mark.

00:01:23.837 --> 00:01:27.690
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:32.496
This gives us a really nice
visualization of where the clusters

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:35.037
are located geographically, so

00:01:35.037 --> 00:01:40.115
that we can see that cluster one
is primarily in Southern Florida,

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:46.319
and cluster five is mostly in the
Northeast section of the United States.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.750
If you're familiar at all with weather
patterns in the US, just looking at this

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.079
map might indicate that the cluster
solution we've created seems reasonable.
