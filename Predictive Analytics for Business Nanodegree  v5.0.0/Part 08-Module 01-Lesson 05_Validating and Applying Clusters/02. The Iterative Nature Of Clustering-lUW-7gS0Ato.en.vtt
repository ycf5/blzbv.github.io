00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.500
We've made it through the process to
where we now have a clustering solution.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.759
That means in the case of our example,

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.559
each store has been
assigned to a cluster.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.240
Or from a business perspective,
each store is in a segment where all

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.089
the other stores in the segment should
closely resemble each other and

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.079
the word should is key here.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.119
As I've said previously,
clustering is not exact.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.490
When working with multiple variables
to determine the cluster solution,

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.850
it can be very likely that objects
in the same cluster are similar for

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.230
most of the variables, but
not necessarily all of them.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:42.879
To take a step back for just a minute,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.889
building a clustering model should
be considered an iterative process.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.640
This means that once you've gone through
the steps to build a good cluster model,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.100
you need to validate that your solution
actually makes sense in the real world.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.719
We've seen that validation occurs
throughout the modeling process and

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.530
we discussed that there are a number
of metrics, and indices that can be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.420
used to help determine the best
number of clusters for a solution.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.219
These were referred to as
an internal validation process.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.810
The final step in the clustering process

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.420
is to validate the clusters
from external data.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.030
In other words,
try to show from the known data

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.209
that the cluster is actually do
indicate differences in results.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.049
Now, this external validation might
indicate that the clusters aren't quite

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.885
good enough for the use case and

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:42.277
that's where the iterative nature of
cluster modeling comes into play.

00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:46.415
A typical process is to run
some initial cluster models.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:50.617
Validate the results with external
data and then rerun the modeling

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:54.975
process with differing variables to
see if improvements can be made.
