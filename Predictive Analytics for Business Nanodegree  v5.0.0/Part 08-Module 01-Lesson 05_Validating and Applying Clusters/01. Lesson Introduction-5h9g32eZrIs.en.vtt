00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.929
In this lesson, we will review
the concept that cluster modeling can be

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:08.301
an iterative process,
with several cycles involved.

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.894
I will be showing you how to validate
your cluster solution using external

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:18.469
data and some ways to display the
results to better communicate the story.

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:21.899
We will also talk about how to
go about using the solution

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.314
from a practical standpoint.
