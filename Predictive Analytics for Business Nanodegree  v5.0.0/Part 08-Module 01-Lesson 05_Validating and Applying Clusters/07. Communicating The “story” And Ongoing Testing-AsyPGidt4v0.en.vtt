00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.339
These types of visualizations are a good
way to communicate the story behind

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.210
the clusters in a way that is more
understandable by management, and

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.089
the users of the segmentation solution.

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.449
Since most business users of your
solution will be more interested

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.750
in how the clusters effect their part
of the business, making it easy for

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.070
them the understand the differences
between the segments,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.469
gets them to that point a lot quicker.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.670
It can even be a good idea to start
out the report of the results

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.939
with some brief names of the clusters
that summarize the findings.

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:39.619
So, in our example exercise,

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:45.119
we could describe Cluster one as the
Grow Anything Anytime segment of stores,

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:50.739
or Cluster five could be the Lots
of Snow Half the Year segment.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.789
A good example of this is how Experient
handles their consumer segmentation.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.460
They divide up the United States
into 71 different segments, and

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.579
have given each a name
that provides the user

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.519
with a way to quickly understand
the basic makeup of the segment.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:12.799
They have segment names like fast
track couples for newly marrieds,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.039
and settled and sensible for
those maybe getting close to retirement.

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.599
Then if you need to understand
what is behind those designations,

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:24.119
you can dig more thoroughly
into the details.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.250
You can download a PDF of their
segment names in the instructor notes.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.609
Of course,

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.540
after the cluster solution has been
agreed upon by management, the real

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.219
validation of the solution is through
testing it out in the real world.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.439
In the case of our exercise,
this would be done through

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.390
the allocation of product
using the created segments.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.980
Depending on the business and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.870
the use case, it may be appropriate
when starting with segmentation, to run

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.800
the tests on a limited number of the
objects first for further validation.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679
This mitigates the risk, for

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.500
some reason, of being totally
off with the segments, and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.120
making the mistake of applying an
invalid solution to the entire business.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.240
As mentioned in an earlier lesson,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.820
you could use the method known as
AD Testing for this kind of process.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.459
This provides the truest
form of external validation.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.614
But even then, clustering should
remain an iterative process.

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:28.620
Whatever your use case for
segmentation and

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.280
clustering, remember that
whatever you are segmenting, and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.360
whatever variables you are using to
cluster, these will continue to change.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.900
Which means that a clustering solution
that is good today, may start

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.620
moving after a couple of years, and
should be re-evaluated as time goes by.
