00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.730
But we would also want to
drill a little further down

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.620
into the details to confirm
this reasonableness.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.490
Let's take a look at the single variable
growing season length by cluster.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.839
Now as an aside,

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.689
I previously said it is best validate
your clusters using variables

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.150
that were not directly included
in the cluster modeling process.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:28.289
In some cases though, the best
variables are the ones that you used.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.189
In our example, since climate is really
built around just a few metrics,

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:38.030
we are using some that we have used
directly in creating the model.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.600
Let's add a new sheet to Tableau.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.049
And you can create the visualization
by dropping the cluster ID

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.919
into the columns.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.692
In the growing season
length into the rows.

00:00:53.692 --> 00:00:57.161
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.441
It will sum these up by default,

00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:04.909
which seems to show some distinctness
around a few of the clusters.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.549
But since it's a sum,

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.137
that could be just because of
the number of stores in a cluster.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:17.751
A better validation visualization would
be using the box-and-whisker plot type.

00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:22.718
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:27.061
You'll need to uncheck aggregate
measures to get it to show the clusters

00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:27.924
separately.

00:01:27.924 --> 00:01:34.185
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:35.945
&gt;From this visualization,

00:01:35.944 --> 00:01:41.149
we can easily see that the behavior
of the clusters is different.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.410
Cluster one obviously has
the longest growing season.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.310
And clusters four, five and
ten have the shortest.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.240
By referring back to our map,
this makes total sense.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.554
Since cluster one is in Florida and
four,

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:04.250
five and
ten are in the northern most states.
