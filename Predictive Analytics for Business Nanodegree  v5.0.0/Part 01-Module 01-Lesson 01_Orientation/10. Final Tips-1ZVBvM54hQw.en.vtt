00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.440
As we wrap things up here, I want to
leave you with some final tips for

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.610
how to be successful in this program.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.119
Number one, stick to your schedule.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.680
Working regularly on your courses and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.190
projects will help you learn effectively
and reach your goals sooner.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.910
Number two,
as one of our first graduates said,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.680
be relentless in searching for
an answer on your own.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.320
The struggle and
search is where you learn the most.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.090
If you come across a term you don't get,
spend time reading up on it.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.750
Using resources outside Udacity
to supplement your learning and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.630
become a more independent
learner is really important.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.270
You'll do research like reading
documentation every single

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.360
day on the job.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.400
So you want to make sure that
you feel comfortable doing that

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.200
from the start here.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.530
Number three,
be an active member of your community.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.030
Another one of our early
grads gives this advice.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.100
Help other students.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100
This will actually make your
understanding more solid too.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.740
And of course,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.490
when you're stuck, take advantage
of the resources available to you.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.450
By doing all of these things,
you'll build up your expertise and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.720
your portfolio, and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.090
you'll demonstrate that you have
tremendous drive and work ethic.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.600
We're so glad to have you with us, and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.980
we're excited to see where you
go with what you learn here.
