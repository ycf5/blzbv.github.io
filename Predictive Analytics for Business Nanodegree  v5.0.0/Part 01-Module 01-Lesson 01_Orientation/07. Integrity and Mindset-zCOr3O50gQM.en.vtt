00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.600
You came to your Nanodegree
program to learn.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.950
So we want to make sure you do
as much of that as possible.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.140
You learn when you grapple
with tough problems,

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.340
when you stretch your
brain to new limits.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.060
To make this happen, it's crucial for
you to work on your projects yourself,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.238
since that's how you'll
hone your skills.

00:00:16.238 --> 00:00:17.650
Throughout your Nanodegree program,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.310
we'll encourage you to share what
you've created with your community and

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.230
you'll have the chance to see what
your peers have worked on as well.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.560
But please be mindful of how other
people's work influences your projects.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.150
Using more than a small part
of work that is not your own

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.570
goes beyond the bounds
of authentic learning.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.400
Keep in mind what your goals are,
to be able to use the skills and

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.370
knowledge you're developing
in the real world.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.340
Let's make sure you get there.
