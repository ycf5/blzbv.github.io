00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.610
Once you finish each project,
you'll submit it to us and

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.610
we'll send it back to you with feedback.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.900
Your evaluation will tell you either
that your project met our specifications

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.290
or that it hasn't yet.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.170
However, you can submit each project
as many times as you need to for

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.820
it to meet our specifications.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.010
We believe that projects are a super
important part of your learning process

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.150
because that process of getting feedback
and making changes in accordance with

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.340
it, thing that you'll do in
the real world all the time.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.390
No one,
not even the most expert engineer,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.230
writes perfect code
the first time around.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.520
So we want you to get in the mindset and

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.680
practice of iterating
on your work right now.
