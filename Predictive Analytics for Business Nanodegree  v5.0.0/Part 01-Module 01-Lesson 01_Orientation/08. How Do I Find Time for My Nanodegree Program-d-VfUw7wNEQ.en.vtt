00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.845
The single biggest contributor to student success in the Nanodegree is time commitment.

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:07.275
The first graduate of any Nanodegree Udacity,

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.255
didn't have any prior experience.

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.154
He simply worked hard and put in time consistently,

00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:15.590
making his Nanodegree part of his daily and weekly schedule.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.800
Now as I mentioned before,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.900
the timeline you're operating on assumes

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.745
that you will work on your Nanodegree for 10 hours a week.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:25.305
Since many students have a lot of other things going on in their lives like jobs,

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:27.015
families or other big commitments,

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:31.530
it's really important to block out time on your calendar every week for your Nanodegree.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.240
While bench learning works well for some people,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.060
the most successful Udacity students

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.490
work on their courses and projects multiple times a week.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.930
Not just in one big chunk,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.040
and really a 10 hour chunk would be exhausting.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.000
This helps the learning you're doing stick

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.850
better since you're thinking about it more frequently.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.130
On top of that, having a regular weekly routine that you

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.275
stick to is really helpful for keeping up your dedication.

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:56.320
Working at about the same time slots each week can be really helpful.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.915
After you do it for a few weeks,

00:00:57.915 --> 00:00:59.630
it'll just feel like second nature.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.500
So go into your calendar right now,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.180
and mark out which times you'll work on the Nanodegree this week and next week.
