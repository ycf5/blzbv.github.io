00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.420
The single biggest contributor to
student success to the Nanodegree

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.980
is time commitment.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.400
The first graduate of any
Nanodegree at Udacity

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.280
didn't have any prior experience.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.120
He simply worked hard, and
put in time consistently

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480
making his Nanodegree part of
his daily and weekly schedule.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.600
Now, as I mentioned before,
the timeline you're operating on

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.810
assumes that you'll work on your
Nanodegree for ten hours a week.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.380
Since many students have a lot of
other things going on in their lives,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.340
like jobs, families, or other big
commitments, it's really important to

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.980
block out time on your calendar
every week for your Nanodegree.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.290
While binge learning works well for

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.880
some people, the most successful Udacity
students work on their courses and

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.160
projects multiple times a week,
not just in one big chunk.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.220
And really,
a ten hour chunk would be exhausting.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.040
This helps the learning you're doing
stick better since you're thinking

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.830
it more frequently.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.600
On top of that, having a regular
weekly routine that you stick to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.430
is really helpful for
keeping up your dedication.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.620
Working at about the same time slots
each week can be really helpful.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.770
After you do it for a few weeks,
it'll just feel like second nature.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.560
So go into your calendar right now and

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.739
mark out which times you'll work on
the Nanodegree this week and next week.
