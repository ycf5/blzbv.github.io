00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.846
By the time you graduate from
your Nanodegree program,

00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:06.210
you'll have mastered relevant skills and
learned to work independently.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.460
And we want to help you get there,
as efficiently as possible.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.670
That's why we focus
on learning by doing.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.320
To graduate,
you'll complete a series of milestones,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.770
most of which will take
the form of projects.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.244
You can prepare for
these projects by taking your courses,

00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:22.670
although reviewing all of the course
material isn't a graduation requirement.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.779
If you've come in with
a ton of prior experience,

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.400
feel free to try jumping
right into the projects.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.300
However, most students go through
the course material thoroughly

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.460
to make sure they have the skills and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.210
knowledge they need to be successful
in their projects and beyond.
