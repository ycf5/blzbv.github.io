00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
There are essentially three final products that people build in

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.314
Tableau: Worksheets, Dashboards and Stories.

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:11.580
A worksheet is essentially one visualization.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.970
When we would like to work with multiple of these visualizations,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.580
we create a dashboard.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.489
And finally, stories are a combination of worksheets and

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.669
dashboards that convey a walkthrough of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.330
our data and multiple key points in a connected way.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.819
In the next concepts,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.199
you're going to learn how to put together worksheets,

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.000
and from here, creating dashboards and stories is going to be really straightforward.
