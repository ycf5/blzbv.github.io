00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.004
The Show Me feature is a quick way to start with a basic graph,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.029
which you can add to afterwards.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.349
You can find it in the top right of the sheet.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.074
You can see that side by side bars,

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:17.219
wants one or more dimensions and one or more measures.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.599
Try selecting market, category, and profit.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.240
You can hold command or control,

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.609
depending on your Operating System and click on multiple fields to select them.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.789
With those selected, select side by side bars and it will create the graph for you.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.750
From there, you can customize the graph.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.119
Show Me is usually a good start,

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:43.049
once you decide what you want to look at.

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:46.859
Feel free to take some time and play around with the Show Me panel.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.214
There are a lot of different plots that you can make.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:53.080
We might choose to update this by changing the color scheme.
