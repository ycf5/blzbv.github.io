00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.950
Table calculations are performed from the results of a view,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.070
like showing the percent of total sales that comes from a particular region.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.990
Let's use a table calculation to show the percent of sales that comes from each market.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.615
First, let's plot the sum of profit by market.

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:17.245
Now by right clicking on sum profit,

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:19.964
you can see add table calculation.

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:22.769
You can manually set the table calculation from

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.300
this window or you can use the quick table calculation from the drop down.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.065
Let's add a quick table calculation to show the percent of total.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:37.859
When we do so, we can quickly see that APAC represents nearly 30 percent of total sales.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.079
Let's try one more example.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.960
Let's use a table calculation to show quarterly sales growth.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.609
To start, let's create a line plot of sales by

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.579
adding sales to the rows and order date to the columns.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.100
Now let's drill down to quarters by clicking this plus sign.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.230
You can see that this creates four different plots.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.199
This is because the order date is currently a discrete variable.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.923
Let's change this by right clicking on order date,

00:01:00.923 --> 00:01:05.995
selecting convert to continuous and then re adding it to the column shelf.

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:08.285
Now we're ready to add the table calculation.

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:10.049
Let's right click on sum of sales,

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.340
select quick table calculation and click on percent difference.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.174
Now we see the percent difference from quarter to quarter.

00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:18.959
Perhaps, we want to get even more granular

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.614
with our aligned plot by drilling down to week.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:25.530
As you can see the data gets pretty erratic at that level of granularity.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.719
We can use a table calculation to use

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.409
a moving average to make the graph more comprehensible.
