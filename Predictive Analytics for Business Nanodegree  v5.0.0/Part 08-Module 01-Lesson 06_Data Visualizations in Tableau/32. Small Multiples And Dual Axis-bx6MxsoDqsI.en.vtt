00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
Small multiples are one of

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:05.955
my favorite visualization techniques and Tableau loves them too.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.634
Simply by dragging multiple dimensions to the columns and row shelves,

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:12.689
creates a small multiple.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.079
You saw this before when learning about hierarchies.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.139
Here we have four separate plots showing how

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.804
the profit grows each quarter through the four years in the data set.

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:26.219
You'll notice the plots are distributed

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.714
horizontally due to the order date fields in the column shelf.

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:32.929
But what's driving this growth?

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:36.229
Maybe one category is the profit leader.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:39.959
You can see this by dragging category to the row shelf.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.109
This will create more plots with the data split by category distributed vertically.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.960
Next, let's talk about dual axes.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.484
Sometimes you want to compare two variables on one plot.

00:00:53.484 --> 00:00:55.975
If you drag two measures to the row shelf,

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:58.774
you get two plots instead of one.

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:03.909
For example, let's try plotting both profit and sales on one figure.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.884
Drag the profit and sales to the row shelf.

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:09.295
You should get something like the image below.

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:11.692
Here, you get two plots,

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:13.634
but we really just want one.

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:17.670
You can convert this to both lines on one plot by

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.990
opening the menu of one of the measures and selecting dual axes.

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:25.689
It should look something like this.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.019
You can do a little shortcut by dragging

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:31.000
the second measure to the right side of the view.
