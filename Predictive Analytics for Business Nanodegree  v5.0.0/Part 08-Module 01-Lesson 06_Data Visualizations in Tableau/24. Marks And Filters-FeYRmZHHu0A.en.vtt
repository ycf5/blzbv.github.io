00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
Let's get some practice with marks and filters.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:05.910
Let's say your boss asks you to dig into the data to better

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.945
understand what regions had the highest profits in 2014.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:15.065
To start, let's drag profit into the row shelf and region into the column shelf.

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:18.884
Now we need to filter the data to only include 2014.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:23.400
To do this, let's drag the order date variable into the filters.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.144
There are lots of ways to implement a date filter,

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:30.869
but in this case, let's select year here and check 2014.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.770
To show the filter, let's click the drop down and select show filter.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.040
Lastly, let's sort the columns from highest to lowest so that chart is more readable.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.619
You can do this with this sort button at the top of the screen.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:45.780
Now let's use some additional variables to help us

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.265
drill down into the product categories.

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:50.210
We start by bringing in the category field.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.954
You can encode this in a variety of ways,

00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:56.920
but the most logical would be to include it in the rows like this,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.890
making a separate bar chart for

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
each category or to encode it as color, which we'll do here.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.784
When we encode categories color,

00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:07.109
you can see a legend appears on the right.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.480
We can use this legend to apply filters by clicking

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.079
on them and selecting keep only, like this.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.039
Now we only see the profit data for furniture.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.790
This adds a category filter to the filter shelf.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.234
And if we want to see it,

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:23.429
we can click the drop down and select show filter.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.120
Now were filtered on furniture and let's add subcategory in as color.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.245
Now we can see the profit attributable to each product subcategory by region.

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:36.945
You can add additional detail to the chart by encoding data with the tool tip.

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:38.204
To finish off this plot,

00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:40.829
let's add sales data to the tool tip card,

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.465
so when you hover over each section,

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:45.000
you can see both the profit and sales.
