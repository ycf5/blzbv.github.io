00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.809
Tableau has two different methods for grouping together data, Groups and Sets.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:09.615
They are similar but have differences I'll go over.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:14.129
Grouping data points together can help illuminate your message.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.450
For instance, if you want to point out the products that are losing money,

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.210
you'd want to create a group of those products and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.015
color them separately from the positive profit products.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.449
Groups are typically created from the view by

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.364
selecting multiple data points within the view.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.409
For example, if I wanted to look at the average quantity

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.474
sold and average profits for the countries in the dataset,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.270
it might look something like this.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.440
There's something interesting here.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:48.394
It looks like there are two clusters with different average quantities.

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.588
You can look more into this by grouping together

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:55.230
one of the clusters and doing more visualizations.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.179
To select the data points with low average quantity,

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.810
hold down the mouse and drag a box over the left cluster.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.150
Then, you can either hover over a data point and a small menu will pop up,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.230
or right click on a data point and a large menu will pop up.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.840
From the hover menu,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.859
you can create the group by clicking the link icon.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.075
It looks like a paperclip to me.

00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:23.100
From the right click menu,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.974
select group, you should see something like this.

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:31.314
Now, there is a group called Country.

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:34.504
This is the group you just created.

00:01:34.504 --> 00:01:39.359
I renamed mine to Low Quantity Countries.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.849
The group is really just a list of the countries you selected in the view,

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.924
as you can see in this edit group menu.

00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:48.944
Now, that you've created the group,

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:51.344
you can use it in other sheets.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:54.359
For instance, I can create a map that shows how

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.795
the Low Quantity Countries are distributed across the world.

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:02.215
Here, I use the group we created to color the map.

00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:05.645
The blue countries are the ones in the group.

00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:11.995
Sets are similar to groups and that you can select data points to create a set from them.

00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:15.300
However, sets can be dynamic where the members

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.344
of the set will change as the underlying data changes.

00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:22.229
Groups on the other hand are static.

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.134
The members will always be the members.

00:02:25.134 --> 00:02:27.929
For example, say you want to see how

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.175
your poor performing products are affecting the overall profits.

00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:37.995
You can create a set from the product names or IDs which lose money.

00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:40.009
To create the set,

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.454
open the menu from the product name,

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:45.465
choose Create and then Set.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.530
This will bring up the menu for editing a set.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.390
Click the Condition tab then select By field,

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.719
Profit, Average, less than zero as seen here.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:02.629
This will create a set of products where the average profit is less than zero.

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.269
We can use the set and plots to encode these products that are losing money.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.590
Let's look at the total profits for the different subcategories of products.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.420
With the set you just made,

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.129
you can split these bars into losses and gains.
