00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.687
So now you have the basics of Tableau.

00:00:02.687 --> 00:00:05.650
What you want to do next is to
collect your figures into a dashboard

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.970
or a story.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.130
With these you can share
your plots with others and

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.960
easily make them interactive, so
they can poke around your data.
