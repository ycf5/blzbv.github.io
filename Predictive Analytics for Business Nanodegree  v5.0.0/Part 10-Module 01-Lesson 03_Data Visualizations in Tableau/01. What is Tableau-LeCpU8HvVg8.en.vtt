00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.900
Welcome back.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.600
Now it's time to start
making some figures.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.230
In this lesson, I'll teach you how
to use software called Tableau

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.405
to create your visualizations.

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:13.930
Tableau makes it simple to import data
from Excel, a text file, a database and

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.380
many other sources.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.520
Then you can easily build
interactive dashboards.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.510
Unlike software such as matplotlib or

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.560
d3, you don't need to know how to
program to make awesome plots.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.142
First, let's hear more
from a Tableau pro.

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:34.549
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm here with Trina Chiasson,
she is a product manager at Tableau.

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:37.555
And today she's going to talk to us
about Tableau and give us some demos.

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:39.210
So, first, before we start,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.510
can you tell us a little bit
about your experience at Tableau?

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.358
&gt;&gt; Sure, and thanks for having me.

00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:46.970
I've been with Tableau for
about a year now,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.820
just over a year, and
I'm a product manager with Tableau.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.086
I focus on innovation at the company,
which means that I get to work with

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:57.493
a lot of different people
across the organization.

00:00:57.493 --> 00:01:01.594
And I came to Tableau from a data
analysis background, as well.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:07.520
&gt;&gt; Awesome, cool, so Tableau is software
for creating data visualizations.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.950
So say I already have my data in Excel,
and I can make visualizations in Excel,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.880
so what is it about Tableau
that is better than Excel?

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.500
Why do I want to use Tableau?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.760
Excel is an amazing product,
it's been around for a very long time.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.520
Actually, it first hit the market,
the first version, in 1985.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.040
So it's kind of hard for

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.920
us to collectively remember what
data analysis was like 30 years ago.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.617
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:33.617 --> 00:01:35.759
&gt;&gt; But
it's come a long way since then, and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.270
Excel has improved dramatically, too.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.190
But Excel is fundamentally designed
as a spreadsheet application for

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.970
holding your data and
doing advanced calculations.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.350
Tableau is designed as an exploratory
tool, a way to quickly see and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.940
understand your data, and do analysis
and really move things around,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.270
change things, iterate and
ask deep questions of your data
