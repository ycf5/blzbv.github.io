00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.904
Calculated fields create new fields from the underlying data,

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.949
such as creating a revenue field by multiplying price times quantity.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.390
Let's create a calculated field.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.580
Maybe you want to know the profit per item for each quarter.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.655
To create a calculated field,

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:19.525
open the menu on the field such as profit,

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:23.894
then click Create, Calculated field. You'll see the editor.

00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:27.625
On the left, you can type in the formula you'd like to use to create the field.

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:30.719
And on the right you'll see different formulas that you can choose from.

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.689
Fields in the editor show up in brackets, like profit.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:36.539
You can do simple arithmetic here,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.869
like adding a constant or multiplying by field.

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:43.349
You can also use functions such as absolute value,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.480
sine, square root, etc..

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.129
There is a list of functions on the right and

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.580
some short documentation is shown when you select one.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.799
Here, we want to create a new field that calculates the profit per item for each record.

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.524
It's pretty simple, just profit divided by quantity.

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:05.030
You can name the calculated field here and I'll name it, profit per item.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.349
Once you hit okay and create it,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.859
a new field shows up in the data pane.

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.000
You can use it like any other field.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.484
For example, I can make a plot of the average profit per item for each subcategory.

00:01:15.484 --> 00:01:17.670
You can see where profit per item shows up in

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.004
the data pane and next to the number symbols a little equal sign.

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:24.869
This indicates that it's a calculated field.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.057
Going back to our original question,

00:01:27.057 --> 00:01:29.385
we wanted to know the average profit per item.

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:31.315
To change from sum to average,

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:32.605
you click the drop down,

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:35.790
go down to measure, and change it to average.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.000
Here you see that profit for copiers is the highest and it's lowest for tables.
