00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Now, let's take a look at the data.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.759
To begin, let's join our Returns table to the Orders table.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.504
The icon here indicates that Tableau has

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:12.054
automatically joined these tables as an inner join.

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:13.379
If you click on the icon,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.540
it'll show the other join options.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.519
You could edit the join to be a left join,

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.355
a right join, or a full outer join.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:25.035
Right now, let's select left join and close the dialog.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:27.690
Now let's click over onto the sheet.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.020
We now have columns from both orders and returns in our datasource.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.630
And we can see which column headers are showing up under which table.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.790
Here you see orders and down below you see returns.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.659
Using the fields from a join table is as easy as using any.
