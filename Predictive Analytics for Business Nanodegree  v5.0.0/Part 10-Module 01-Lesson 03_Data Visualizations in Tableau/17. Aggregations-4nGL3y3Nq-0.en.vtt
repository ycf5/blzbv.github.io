00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.279
There are two ways to start analyzing data in Tableau.

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:04.949
You can either jump in and start exploring,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.919
or you can ask questions of your data and attempt to answer them.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.685
We'll start by asking this data set superstore.

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:12.560
What are our sales like over time?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.894
If we simply double click sales in order date,

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:20.189
Tableau creates a timeline and we can see our sales are increasing over time.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.770
Note that the mark type here says automatic.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.960
We can change this to be another mark type if we wanted to.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.500
There's a bunch of mark types available to work with.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.155
One thing to note is if the mark type is automatic,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.600
it can change as you make changes to the view.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.265
Let's ask another question.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:38.115
What is the relationship between shipping costs and profit?

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:41.789
This time, we're given what looks like the start of a scatter plot.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.164
However, Tableau is aggregating our data to

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:48.704
the overall sum of shipping costs and the sum of profit, so we only have one mark.

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:51.600
We can bring in another field into the view to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.035
change our breakdown of marks, such as category.

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:57.399
If we encode categories color,

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.799
we see one mark for each category.

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.625
If we bring in another field like market to shape,

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.870
we get a mark per category per market.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.066
The dimensions we add to the view like category and market,

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.204
define the number of marks that we see,

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.757
or the granularity in which we see the data.

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:17.829
It's easy to change your mind about any variable that we encode.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.614
For example, if we want to change color from category to order priority,

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:25.375
we simply drag order priority into the color shelf.

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:28.974
Now we see a mark per order priority per market.

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:34.000
If we want to make marks at a certain granularity but without encoding by color or shape,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.500
we can bring the field to the level of detail shelf.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.453
It's important to know how adding dimensions to the marks card impacts the visual.

00:01:41.453 --> 00:01:43.094
And the better you understand this,

00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:46.000
the more precisely you can build data visualizations.
