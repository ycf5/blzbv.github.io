00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
We've already seen how much visualizations can

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.480
enhance the amount of information we're able to understand about our data.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.915
Tableau takes this another step further,

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:15.789
by allowing anyone within a company to ask and answer questions about a dataset.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.195
These visualizations can be exploratory,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.019
or explanatory in nature.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.894
But the real key is how much faster these insights can be found,

00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:26.640
due to the interactive nature of Tableau.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.949
The best way to learn any new tool,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.030
is for you to use it yourself.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.425
However it can be hard to get started in a new environment.

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:36.854
Therefore, this class is structured in a way,

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:41.369
where you will first watch one of us here at Udacity demonstrate a task in Tableau.

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:44.039
The next concept following each video,

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.879
will hold text and images about the previous video.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.960
Many students prefer this because it's easier to search using control F,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.509
or some other text finding functionality,

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.189
rather than finding the right spot in a video.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:01.859
However, if you're ready to jump in and explore directly following the video,

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.719
feel free to skip the text,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.909
and dive right into the quizzes on the next concept.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.439
The quiz portions are the key to your mastery of Tableau.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.894
The more you are doing,

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:14.149
the better you will get at Tableau.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.240
This is the essential element to gaining confidence with this tool.

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.834
Sometimes, the text, video,

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.579
and quiz, won't be exactly the same.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.784
But they will all use the same tools,

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:30.969
and each is aim to give you practice using a particular part of Tableau.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.045
This lesson might look a bit daunting,

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:35.820
but really there's a lot of repetition of material,

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.339
just depending on how you learn best.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.515
Researchers suggest that you learn best by doing.

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:43.000
So let's get started with that.
