00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Sheets are where we can build visualizations.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.415
Let's go over some of the various areas on the screen.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:07.500
At the top, we have the menus.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.810
Menus contain a lot of powerful options and I

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.350
recommend clicking through to see which options they have.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.789
The logo button here brings us back to the start experience,

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.679
where we can access saved data sources,

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.704
recently opened or pinned workbooks.

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:21.659
To the left of the screen is the data pane.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.155
If we're on the Data tab,

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:27.660
the topless all open data sources and depending on which one is selected,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.905
the fields from that data source are listed below,

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.120
broken out into dimensions and measures.

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.589
The data pane will also show any sets or parameters we have.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.600
If we open the maps layer or the format pane,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.410
these temporarily cover the data pane.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.294
If we click on the analytics tab,

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.450
we can bring out pieces of our analysis directly as drag and drop elements.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.255
If they're not relevant to the type of view,

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:52.635
certain elements will be grid out,

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:54.464
such as totals on a timeline.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:56.430
If we select something like a trend line,

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.439
we can bring it out to any of these drop down areas to control aspects of its properties,

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:04.274
like model type or which measure it should be applied to.

00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:06.940
New sheets are found down here at the bottom.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.325
We can create sheets,

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:11.710
dashboards or stories with these tabs.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:13.199
We can do things like, rename sheets,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.760
duplicate sheets, copy formatting, many other things.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.230
Finally and perhaps more importantly, we have the shelves.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.840
These can be built by dragging and dropping fields from

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.245
the data pane into the canvas directly or onto shelves.

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:28.890
Shelves are sometimes referred to as cards.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.545
There's the column shelf and the row shelf up here,

00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:34.739
the pages and filter shelves and the marks cards.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:37.844
The marks card is made up of several other shelves,

00:01:37.844 --> 00:01:40.469
each of which can have fields placed on

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.319
them and can be clicked on to edit the characteristics.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.339
Changing the marks type can change the shelves on the marks cards such as,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.130
selecting shape brings up the shape shelf.

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:52.674
Depending on the composition of the view,

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:55.829
there can be multiple marks cards, one for each measure.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.039
Legends such as color, size and shape,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.185
will automatically be created when a field is placed on the color,

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:03.674
size or shape shelf.

00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:08.283
However, legends can be removed by clicking on the menu and selecting hide card.

00:02:08.283 --> 00:02:09.685
To bring the legend back,

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:12.335
right click anywhere off the canvas itself,

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:14.490
select legend and choose the one you want.
