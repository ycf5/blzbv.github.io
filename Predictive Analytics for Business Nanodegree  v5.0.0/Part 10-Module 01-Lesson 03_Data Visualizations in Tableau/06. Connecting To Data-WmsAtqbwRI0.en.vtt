00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.314
Tableau can connect to many data sources.

00:00:02.314 --> 00:00:04.714
You will notice here in the connect pane,

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:08.474
we have a long list of connections to all sorts of data sources,

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.349
whether it's local files,

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.084
databases on-premises, or in the cloud.

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:14.430
If you're using Tableau Public,

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.469
you'll see fewer add source options.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.960
Today we'll be using the global superstore excel file,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.035
which you can find in the lesson resources.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:26.935
Superstore is a dataset of sales for a global retail chain that sells furniture,

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.434
office supplies, and technology goods.

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.929
Each row of data represents a single item in a transaction.

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.539
To connect to the superstore file in Tableau,

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.200
click on Excel and navigate to where you downloaded the file.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.775
Now you see the data source page.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.894
On the left you can see all the sheets in the Excel file.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:48.240
Sheets in Excel are treated the same as tables and database,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.135
and we can choose to connect to a single table or join multiple tables.

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:54.914
Simply drag a sheet onto the canvas.

00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:58.189
Tables can be renamed simply by double clicking on the name.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:01.030
And we can see the data down here in the grid.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.884
There's a lot we can do on this screen.

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:07.200
For example, we can rename variables by double clicking on the titles.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.225
We can change the variable types by clicking on this icon here,

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:13.554
and there's a drop-down for more advanced options.

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:15.915
A workbook can have multiple data sources.

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:20.570
If you click Add here, you can add another data source as a cross database joint.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.984
If you want to add another data source entirely,

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:27.239
you can go up here to Data, New Data Source.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:28.619
This will allow you to access

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.350
multiple data sources as you're creating your visualizations.
