00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Hierarchies in Tableau give you the ability to drill down into your data.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.770
Tableau automatically makes hierarchies for timebase data.

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.484
So let's start with an example using order date.

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:13.500
Create a line chart showing some of profit by order date.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.115
A line plot is Tableau as default for time data.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:19.589
There's the little plus symbol on the order date pill now.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.719
Let's click it and see what happens.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.739
What we've done here is drill down into the hierarchy starting with yearly data,

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.454
then grouping it by quarter.

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:30.389
As you drill down even further,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.250
you can see the data in a more granularity.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.420
You will notice the pills have a little minus sign in them now.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.359
Clicking on it, will go back up the hierarchy.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.250
You can also remove levels of the hierarchy from

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.359
the plot by dragging the pill out of the shelf.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.054
If you drill down to month then remove year and quarter,

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:48.774
you'll see something like this.

00:00:48.774 --> 00:00:50.585
It might not be what you expect here.

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:53.575
I expect this to show monthly profit over the four years in the data.

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:56.575
However, there is only one value for each month.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:00.585
Tableau is doing this because order date has been set to the discrete data type.

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:03.505
So it's aggregating the profit values for each month.

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:05.310
That is each value,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.085
is the sum of profit for that month over the four years in the data.

00:01:09.084 --> 00:01:13.034
However, I'd typically like to see this as one long line over all four years.

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:15.287
To change how this is being plotted,

00:01:15.287 --> 00:01:18.114
you need to convert order date to continuous data.

00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:21.074
One way you can do this is by going to the field menu,

00:01:21.075 --> 00:01:25.250
clicking on the triangle and selecting convert to continuous.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.155
Once you add order date back to the visualization,

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:30.585
you'll see the plus sign here again.

00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:32.129
If you click it twice,

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:35.905
you'll get right back down to see the order date by month.

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:39.329
But this time, you'll see it for every month in the dataset.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.138
Tableau created the hierarchy from the date automatically,

00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:43.890
but you can also create your own hierarchies.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.409
For example, each value and subcategory belongs

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.590
to one category in the superstore dataset.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.650
This means that a record with

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.859
a subcategory value bookcases always has a category value furniture.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.420
However, Tableau doesn't recognize this as a hierarchy.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.674
So we can make a manual one.

00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:05.444
You can do this easily by dragging subcategory onto category.

00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:09.000
Then you can name the hierarchy and I'll name it products.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.539
It shows up on the left and you can drag it in the shelves just like a normal field.

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:18.000
But now it starts with category with a plus sign and you can drill down to subcategory.
