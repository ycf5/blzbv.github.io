00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.149
Now that we've seen a quick glimpse at

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.924
the plots that are possible for a number of scenarios,

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.939
let's go through a quick example to see the difference

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:12.480
and the questions we can answer using these plots.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.905
Consider I run a blog and I want to understand traffic on the blog.

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:20.895
For simplicity, let's just use 12 months worth of traffic.

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:24.179
If we wanted to know which month we had the most traffic,

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.899
the best plot would be a bar chart or Pareto chart,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.137
as this would put the months in order from highest to lowest traffic.

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:36.604
Each bar is the amount of traffic for a particular month.

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:41.204
It is pretty easy to see that November had the highest amount of traffic.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:44.964
If we wanted to know if traffic was increasing over time,

00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:47.115
the best chart would be a line chart.

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:49.125
The same information is present here,

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.274
but it's easier to see that overall traffic appears to be

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:57.024
increasing just from the changing in the bars to a line.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.964
If we had multiple years of data,

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:01.915
the line chart would also assist in identifying if

00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:06.224
particular months had higher or lower traffic than others.

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:08.604
Maybe September would always be a low,

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:12.665
and November would always be higher than the other months in the year.

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:15.780
What if we had multiple years worth of data and we wanted

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.409
to know what the distribution of the number of visitors looked like.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.799
How frequently were there more than 2,000 visitors in a month?

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.319
What was the most common number of visitors?

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.239
From either the bar or the line chart,

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:29.909
this can be tough to tell.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.914
And neither of these questions are aimed at understanding the time component.

00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:37.455
We're interested in specifically looking at the count.

00:01:37.454 --> 00:01:41.084
A histogram of the number of visitors looks like this,

00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:46.134
and it's useful for better understanding the typical number of visitors in a month.

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:52.015
And the height of the bars tells us how often a certain number of visitors has occurred.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:55.655
Is seeing 500 visitors on the blog a rare occurrence?

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:58.879
We can quickly see that 500 is rare.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:02.265
We can see that there are always more than 200 visitors,

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:05.430
but there are rarely more than 1,200 visitors.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.390
The most common number of visitors is between 325 and 450.

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:16.444
These observations would have been much more difficult to see on those earlier plots.

00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:18.729
In the instructor notes below,

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.629
I've provided a link to the Google Sheets data and

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.590
charts that were used for creating the visuals in this presentation.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.935
Again, because of the time component in the data,

00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:31.485
the line chart is probably best,

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:35.295
but it ultimately depends on the message that you want to convey.

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:37.104
Using the same data,

00:02:37.104 --> 00:02:40.049
we just found three ways to present the data.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.719
The right way to visualize the data is in the way

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.000
that best helps you answer your question.
