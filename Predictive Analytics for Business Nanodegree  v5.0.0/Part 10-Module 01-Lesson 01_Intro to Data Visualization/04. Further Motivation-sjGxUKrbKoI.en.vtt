00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
In the previous quiz,

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.230
you were introduced to four data sets of X,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.070
Y pairs and you found that they all share the same mean and standard deviation.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.490
So you might think that the points are very similar to one another.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.379
It turns out, the mean,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.570
the variance, the correlation,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.304
and the line of best fit are all exactly the same for these four data sets.

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:26.109
But how similar are these data sets really?

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.119
It turns out, not very.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.105
This is something called Anscombe's quartet and

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:35.159
demonstrates how important it is to always plot your data.

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.504
It is important that you pick out visual patterns, trends,

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.765
and outliers during your analysis,

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:44.969
as relying on only summary statistics can be misleading.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.390
Below is a link to Alberto Cairo's DataSaurus which

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.530
shows another example which is even crazier than this example.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.715
He uses the same idea but he finds a star,

00:00:55.715 --> 00:01:00.270
a circle, and a data source that all share the same summary statistic.
