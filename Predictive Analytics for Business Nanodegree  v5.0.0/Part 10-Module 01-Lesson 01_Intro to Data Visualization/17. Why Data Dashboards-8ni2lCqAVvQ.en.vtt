00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.294
Sometimes a single plot cannot convey all the information in a data set.

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:08.400
Say we want to compare price to sales,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.824
by location and by product.

00:00:10.824 --> 00:00:15.559
And then additionally we want to see how these changes happen over time.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.910
You can imagine that having all this information

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.804
together would be really helpful for a company.

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.535
But if we try to put it into a single plot,

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:27.480
it gets to the point where you won't find any insights at all.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.925
This is where data dashboards come into play.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:33.149
Dashboards allow you to interact with your data,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.994
and view multiple aspects of your data all in the same visual environment.

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:39.629
In the next concept,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.700
you will see an example of a dashboard by Hans Rosling that really comes alive.
