Hi there, I'm Mat Leonard.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.870
I'll be your instructor for
this course on data visualization.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.119
Where you'll be learning how to create
graphics for exploring data and

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.440
sharing your results.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.745
When we're talking about
data visualization,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.507
we mean the visual display
of quantitative information.

00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:17.880
It's the name of this book,
Edward Tufte's seminal work.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.291
This thing is beautiful and
it's essential for

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:21.985
anyone interested in database.

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:27.473
If this isn't enough an endorsement,
maybe President Obama can convince you.

00:00:27.473 --> 00:00:30.130
Use visualizations to tell a story.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.970
Here's a graph showing the number of
times have been attacked from my evil

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.500
kitten Chihiro.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.410
I've made a data points pictures of my
face indicating how much pain I was in.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.650
What's the story here?

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.670
Tuesday was a rough day for me.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.030
Wednesday was pretty great, and Chihero
is a tiny tiger occupying my home.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.100
In this course, you'll learn how to
design and create visualizations.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.020
First, I'll cover fundamentals and
design principles.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.720
Then, you'll learn how to
actually make visualizations.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.240
Let's get started.
