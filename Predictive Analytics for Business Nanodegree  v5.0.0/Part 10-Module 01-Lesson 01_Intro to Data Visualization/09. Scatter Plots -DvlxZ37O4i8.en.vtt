00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.964
If you're comparing two quantitative variables to one another,

00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:05.929
say price and sales,

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:07.929
or heights and weights,

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.800
the most common plot for such an analysis is the scatter plot.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.690
These plots can be used to visualize

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:20.144
both the strength and the direction of the relationship between the two variables.

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:23.765
This is an example of a strong positive relationship,

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:29.530
that is, as one variable increases the other variable also increases.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.380
While this is an example of a strong negative relationship.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.600
That is, as one variable increases the other variable decreases.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.810
As the points become more spread out from one another,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.969
this weakens the relationship.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.210
So to identify strong or weak relationships,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.439
we aren't so much looking at the slope associated with the relationship,

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.234
which is changing here.

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:55.039
These all have the same strength.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.469
But rather, the closeness of the points as we saw before.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.034
Generally, we consider strength as either weak,

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:09.239
moderate or strong, and direction as simply positive or negative.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:11.359
A numeric value used to capture

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.974
these two aspects is known as the correlation coefficient,

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:19.549
often just denoted by a lower case r. The correlation coefficient

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.620
is used to tell us the strength and the direction of a linear relationship.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.180
The correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.540
where the closer it is to 1 or -1,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.520
the stronger the relationship.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.979
The negative tells you that there's a negative relationship,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.225
while a positive tells you there's a positive relationship.

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:45.099
You will get some practice with this in the quizzes that follow.
