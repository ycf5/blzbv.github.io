00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.549
Learning how to communicate insight from

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.705
data is one of the most crucial skills anyone can have.

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:13.150
And usually, the most compelling way to communicate information about data is visually,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.070
but creating good data visualizations really combines two skills.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.129
First, there is a design and artistic component to

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:24.487
create something that is beautiful and compelling.

00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:28.725
And then, there's a strong scientific and mathematical component

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:32.125
in being able to deliver the right insights.

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:35.244
The role of the next lessons is to help you build

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:41.164
data visualizations and do so in a way that is engaging and informative.

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:44.049
Specifically, in this lesson you will learn why

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.989
data visualizations are more useful than just

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.870
using some real statistics and you will learn

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.424
the most common plots used in data visualization.

00:00:53.424 --> 00:00:55.914
We will finish the lesson by introducing

00:00:55.914 --> 00:01:00.530
a data dashboard in motivating the next lesson on design principles.
