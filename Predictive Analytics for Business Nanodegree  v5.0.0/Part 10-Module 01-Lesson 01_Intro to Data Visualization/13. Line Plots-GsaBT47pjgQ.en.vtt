00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
If we're looking at a quantitative variable over time,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.721
which happens all the time in business,

00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:09.375
a common plot to visualize this situation is a line plot.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.068
We commonly see these plots used to analyze stock prices and at Udacity,

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.900
we frequently use them to look at enrollments.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.924
These plots can quickly help us determine the overall trend in our data.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:26.325
For stocks, we can see is the price overall increasing or is that overall decreasing.

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:29.234
We can observe if there are any unusual spikes in the data.

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:32.549
We can also see if there are seasonal effects with peaks

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.049
and valleys in the same seasons across different years.
