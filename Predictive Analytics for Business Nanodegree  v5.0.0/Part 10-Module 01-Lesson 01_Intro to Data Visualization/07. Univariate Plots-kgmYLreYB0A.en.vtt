00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.389
What visualization you use,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.214
not only depends on what data types you're working with but also

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:11.730
on how many columns in your dataset you want to look at in a single plot.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.169
If you were only interested in one column in your dataset,

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.429
this is called univariate analysis where the uni here stands for one.

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.370
Before we talk about comparing variables to one another,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.025
it's important that you know which plots to create for univariate analysis.

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:30.604
For univariate quantitative data,

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.920
both continuous and discrete,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.950
the most common plot to visualize the data is known as a histogram.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.615
However, we could also use a Box-and-Whisker plot,

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:45.460
a Stem-and-Leaf plot or what is known as a Normal Quantile plot.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.070
If you were plotting one quantitative variable,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.355
there are rare cases in which you might use a plot other than a histogram.

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:55.669
For univariate categorical data,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.500
the most common plot is a bar chart.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.719
A bar chart is like a histogram but the bins are determined based on

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.109
a set category and not based on a range that the chart creator can change.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:11.864
Other common plots include pie charts, and pareto charts.

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.079
Pareto charts are essentially just bar charts where

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.724
the bars are in order from the most frequent to the least frequent.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.799
In manufacturing companies, pareto charts are used

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.629
all the time to determine which parts have the most problems.

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:29.524
If you are working with an ordinal categorical variable

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:32.425
it makes more sense to use a bar chart.

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:35.484
I personally don't care for pie charts.

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:38.015
I also always try to avoid

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:43.269
three dimensional plots as they can be misleading but we'll get more to this later.
