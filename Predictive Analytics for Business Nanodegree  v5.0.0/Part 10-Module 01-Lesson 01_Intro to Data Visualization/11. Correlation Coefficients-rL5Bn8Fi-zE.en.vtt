00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
There are some rules of thumb when looking at correlation coefficients.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.323
However, this is a highly field-dependent measure.

00:00:08.323 --> 00:00:10.271
In the social sciences,

00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:15.070
it can be very hard to find strong relationships because humans are complex.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.640
So the boundaries for the correlation coefficient for

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.640
this field tend to be very different than say,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.530
the environmental associations that we find.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.995
So again, this is just a rule of thumb.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:31.185
If a correlation coefficient is between 1 and 0.7,

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:34.259
or between negative 1 and negative 0.7,

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.198
this is considered a strong relationship.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.380
If it's between 0.7 and 0.3,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.679
or negative 0.7 and negative 0.3,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.798
this is considered a moderate relationship.

00:00:46.798 --> 00:00:49.152
And if the absolute value is below 0.3,

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:53.070
then this is considered a weak relationship.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.344
Remember, a negative correlation coefficient is not indicative of a weak relationship.

00:00:59.344 --> 00:01:02.310
Additionally, a plot can assist in

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.189
better understanding the relationships between two variables.

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:10.063
If we take two of the images from Anscombe's quartet,

00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:14.983
notice that these two data sets have the exact same correlation coefficient.

00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:18.000
However they look very different.
