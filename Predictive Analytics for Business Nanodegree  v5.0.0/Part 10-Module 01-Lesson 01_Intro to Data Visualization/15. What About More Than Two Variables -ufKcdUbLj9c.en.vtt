00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
When looking at variables over time or

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.955
comparing two quantitative variables to each other,

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.570
the choices we use to visualize these cases are standardized to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.754
the line plot and the scatter plot we saw in the previous concepts.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:17.929
However, when we introduce categorical variables into our visualization,

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.774
many more options now become available.

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:23.669
And how to visualize the relationships between

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.280
categorical variables as well as with a categorical and a quantitative variable?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.674
For example, if I want to compare two categorical variables with one another,

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:37.529
we would probably use something like a side by side bar chart,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.734
which shows the grouping for one category.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:47.317
This case, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry are grouped in color for the other variable,

00:00:47.317 --> 00:00:49.439
the three locations in this case.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:54.859
We can quickly identify the favorite flavor in each location.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.905
If we have more than two variables,

00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:01.170
say we wanted to view sales over time for different products,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.810
here we have three variables: sales, time and products.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.950
We might start with a line chart since we're dealing with time.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.049
Then, we could break out each product into its own line.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.939
Color the line and add a legend to provide the product name.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.289
Now we can see which products are performing well and this can help us make

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.790
more product specific decisions than if we just looked at aggregately sales.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.755
We might instead use a stacked line chart for the situation.

00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:38.564
The visual provides essentially the same information but

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:42.959
each product is shown in terms of proportion of the total sales.

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.354
Another alternative could be to use a stack bar chart by year.

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:54.260
Each product has a color in the bar and the height of the bar is the amount of sales.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.300
Is one of these approaches better than another?

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.575
I guess it depends on who you ask.

00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:01.510
In the upcoming concepts,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.980
you will see how visual encodings influenced the way we interpret

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.170
information and in turn how well we can draw insights from the data.
