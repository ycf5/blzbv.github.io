00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.600
The different colors and sizes of each country in

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.095
the previous example are what are known as Visual Encodings.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:11.349
Visual Encodings are the way we show our variables in a plot.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.934
There are a number of these encodings that exist,

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:17.440
including which variables we put on x and y axis,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.094
should you use color,

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:22.500
should you use bars or points or lines,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.254
should the points have different shapes or textures.

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:29.939
Each of these is a design component for your visual and there are

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.520
scientific studies that suggest how to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.350
encode your visuals to best communicate your findings.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.825
Now that we have a base set of plots to consider

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:42.270
the next lesson will help you better

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.330
understand the design components for your visualizations.
