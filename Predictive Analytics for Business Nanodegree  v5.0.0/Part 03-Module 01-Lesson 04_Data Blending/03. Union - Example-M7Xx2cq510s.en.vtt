00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.150
In this example,
we're starting with two data sets,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.188
customer data from 2010 and
customer data from 2011.

00:00:10.188 --> 00:00:14.371
And we want to create one data
set with all of the customers for

00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.470
both 2010 and 2011.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.140
However, you don't always get data
sets in the exact same format.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.340
Sometimes they have
different field names, and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.070
sometimes they have extra fields that
don't exist in all the data sets.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.729
Notice that in the first data set,
we have the fields ID and Name.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.850
Yet the second data set has a different
name field called Full Name, and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.690
an additional field called Phone.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.200
We're going to union
these data sets together,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.650
even though they have
different field names and

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.940
an extra field,
that are not common to both data sets.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.570
To do this, we simply drag in the Union
tool, bringing it close to the customer

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.080
data 2010 data set so
that it attaches to this data set first.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.150
Then we manually draw a connection
from customer data 2011 data set

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.950
to the Union tool.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.370
The Union tool can have
unlimited inputs into it.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.730
So you can union more
than just two data sets.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.290
Now we can configure the tool.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.060
Coming to the Configuration
area on the left,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.780
it says Auto Configure
by Name up at the top.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.340
This is the default way of
configuring the Union tool.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.720
When we run the work flow and
we look at the output,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.350
we can see that the data in
the ID field is lined up.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.370
But the data in the name field is not,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.340
as there are both Name and Full Name
fields containing name information.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.700
To get the fields to line up better,
we choose Manually Configure Fields.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.040
Then we click on Full Name, we click
on the arrow moving it to the left so

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.950
that it's now lined up
with the Name field.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.357
And then to remove the gap between
these two fields, we select Phone and

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:09.429
click on the left arrow again
to move that field over.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.359
[SOUND] When we run the work flow,
you can see all of the names in the Name

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.100
field now, and
all the fields lined up as expected.
