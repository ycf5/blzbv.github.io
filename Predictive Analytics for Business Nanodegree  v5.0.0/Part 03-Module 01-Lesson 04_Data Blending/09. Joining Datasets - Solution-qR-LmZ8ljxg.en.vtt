00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:03.870
How many records are joined
between the two datasets?

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.670
To join the datasets together,
we connect up the Join tool and

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.270
make sure each side is connected in.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.480
Then we select the two
fields to make the join on.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.530
We need to understand the data first, so

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.810
we look at the fields that
are the same between the two datasets.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.970
Then we select first name and
last name from the drop downs.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.750
Notice how when I select
the field on the left,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.080
the field on the right is
automatically populated.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.120
This is because it has the exact
same spelling in the second dataset.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.050
If it didn't, we would have to
manually select it for ourselves.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.639
When we run the workflow [SOUND], we can
check both the left output and right

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:49.316
output sides to see if there was any
fallout or if any records didn't join.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:53.160
However, there are no records
on either of those sides.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.850
So we go to the J output and
we can see that six records were joined.
