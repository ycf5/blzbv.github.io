00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
We just learned how to take two
data sets with the same fields and

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.550
union them together to
make a longer data set.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.380
But what if you want to blend multiple
data sets with different data?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.620
For instance,
pretend we want to create this really

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.060
great 360 view of our customers, so
we can build a predictive model from it.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.490
We'll want to start with as much
information about the customers

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.680
that we can get,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.010
before we can determine which variables
we'll want to use in the model.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
We'll take a transaction data set that's
summarized to the customer level,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.590
showing their total transactions,
total spend, etc.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.358
Then we might want to use
another data set that shows what

00:00:41.358 --> 00:00:44.914
marketing campaigns they responded to.

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:48.839
Maybe, we can even pull in a third data
set with their address data showing

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.340
how far these customers are located
from their store locations.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.850
To blend these data sets together,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.810
we'll need some information in common
amongst all three of these files.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.660
That information in common
is what's going to tie

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.280
each record in each data set to
the same record in the other data sets.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.890
In the example here,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.550
we can see that each data set has an ID
number associated with each record.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.080
We use this field to join
the three data sets together.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.129
However, we may not always have a field
like ID to join data sets together with.

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:25.977
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:28.980
You need to look at the fields
in your data sets and

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.810
figure out which fields can be
used to join to other data sets.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.790
For instance, maybe you're joining data
sets together related to products.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.610
In that case, you might be able to
use some kind of product code or SKU.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.130
Which stands for stock keeping unit.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.890
And is frequently represented
by a machine bar code.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.050
Or maybe you have to use a combination
of fields that might make the record

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.330
unique.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.845
For instance, if you don't have
a customer ID on each record,

00:01:59.845 --> 00:02:03.420
maybe you have to join on first name,
last name,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.770
and address fields to identify
the same customers in each data set.
