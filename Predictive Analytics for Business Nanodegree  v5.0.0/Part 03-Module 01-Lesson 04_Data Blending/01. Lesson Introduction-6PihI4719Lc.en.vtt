00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.590
So far, we've learned how to acquire
data sets and format the data fields.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.030
We've also learned how to identify and
clean dirty data and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.570
how to reshape the data
sets into the form we need.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.690
You'll need to think
about these ideas and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.910
apply them to nearly every
data set you use for analysis.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.020
However, you rarely
would just have one file

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.380
that has all the data you need in it.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.000
You're going to want to use as much
data as is relevant to your analysis.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.590
That data may come from
different places, and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.660
as a result, it'll all need to be
stitched together into one data file.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.890
This is what we call data blending.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.500
And it can be done in many ways.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.610
In this lesson, we will learn how to
blend data through Unions, Joins,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.960
Fuzzy Matching, and by Spatial Matching.
