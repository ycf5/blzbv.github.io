00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.840
We're going to take
the example just mentioned and

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.600
illustrate how you can do this Alteryx.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.490
We're going to count how many
customers fall within five miles

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.550
of each store location.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.219
We start our workflow with two files,
a store location file.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.880
It's in Alteryx native format
with the extension yxdb, and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.680
the other file is a customer
file in CSV format.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.760
Notice that the customer's
file has a latitude and

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.110
longitude field associated
with each of the customers.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.390
We can use this data to create
spacial points for each customer,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.790
making it possible to use this
data set for spacial matching.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.560
Now let's go back to
the store locations.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.450
Notice how this file has field called
spacial obj with a value point.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.800
That means that the records already have
a point spacial object attached to them.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.820
To confirm this, we can simply add
a browse tool and run the workflow.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.580
When we do this,
we can see points on a map on the left.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.792
We'll use cloud made maps
as the base map layers, so

00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:13.924
that we can view the map
with reference map layers.

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:18.012
But if we add a browse tool
to the customer's file,

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:21.158
we'll see only tabular data, no map.

00:01:21.158 --> 00:01:24.661
So we know that this file is
not spatially enabled yet.

00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:28.797
To spatially enable a file,
we go to the Spatial category, and

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.380
select the tool called Create Points.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.300
Once connected,
we identify the longitude and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.715
latitude fields in the customer file.

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.205
By adding a browse tool and

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:43.775
then running the work flow,
we'll see the customers on a map.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:45.425
Coming back to the stores,

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:50.635
we wanted to find the trade area around
each store as a five-mile radius.

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:54.285
To create this,
we add in the Trade Area tool.

00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:58.625
And we're going to specify the value
of the trade area to be 5 and

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.690
the units to be radius in miles.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.710
Let's bring in a browse tool so
we can see the radii.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.830
Browse tools always have to be used when
we're looking at the actual map objects.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.250
They're not required for
looking at tabular data.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.720
We can see the trade areas here,
and if we look close,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.030
we can see that there's overlap
between two of the trade areas.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.430
This could actually be removed by
going back to the Trade Area tool and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.940
selecting the option
to eliminate overlap.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.670
When we run the work flow again, we can
see that the overlap is eliminated,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.420
basically by drawing a straight line
on the edges where the two radii meet,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.580
getting rid of the overlap.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.140
Next, we'lll use a spacial match tool

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.100
to find the customers that fall
within the five mile radii
