00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.220
To answer the question, how many
patients are in the 30 mile radius for

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.350
hospital one,
we'll review the solution work flow.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.730
Because the hospital's geo-coded file
already has a spatial object on it

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.510
we can immediately move to
creating trade areas for it.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.840
In the trade area tool, we specify
the trade area sizes as 10, 20,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.930
30, putting a comma between each value.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.670
Next we move to the patient's file, and
notice that while it has a LATITUDE and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.690
LONGITUDE field,
there is no spatial object.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.960
So we use the Create Points
tool to add the point locations

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.950
pointing to the latitude and
longitude fields.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.580
In the next step, we're simply
renaming the spatial object field for

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.020
the patients, so that it's
easier to recognize downstream.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.700
Next, we configure
the spatial match tool

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.630
with the trade area in the target and
the patients in the universe area.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.070
The method for
spatial matching is intersects.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080
Notice below, that for

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.010
every hospital trade area we'll
be able to attach a patient ID.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.330
And because we simply want to count
patients in the hospital trade areas,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.300
we can simply keep the patient ID field
and deselect the rest of the fields.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.410
Out of the Spatial Match tool is a list
of patients that fall within each

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.210
hospital trade area, along with,
the trade area size and the patient ID.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.240
To count the number of patients for each
trade area, we use the Summarize tool.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.370
We group by on the name
of the hospital and

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.000
the radius size, and count the number
of patients by counting the patient ID.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.620
To select the one record for
a 30 mile radius for

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.560
hospital one, we can use a filter
tool based on those two criteria.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.160
The result is the count for
hospital one for

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.090
the 30 mile radius,
which is 497 patients.
