00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.790
You may have come across a situation
where someone has sent you some data,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.920
but for whatever reason,
it's been split into multiple files.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.260
This is often done,
because there are too many records.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.640
And they exceed the maximum number
of records any one file can handle.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.870
For instance, the maximum
number of records you can put

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.610
into an Excel worksheet
is just over a million.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.070
So, if you had 3 million records
of data, and you wanted to

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.280
use Excel to hold the data, it would
need to be split into three worksheets.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.830
But then how do you use all of
that data in your analytics?

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.210
That's where unioning comes in.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.907
Unioning allows you to take multiple
datasets and deal with them as one.

00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:44.994
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:49.106
It's easier to format or
clean up one large dataset than to have

00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:53.100
to repeat these same operations
across multiple datasets.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.220
And then bring them together afterwards.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.850
Unioning appends multiple data
streams into one unified stream.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.155
This makes a longer dataset containing
records from both of the original

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:06.535
datasets.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.540
Picture stacking records from one file
on top of records from another file,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.850
making sure to line up the columns or
fields that are common between them.
