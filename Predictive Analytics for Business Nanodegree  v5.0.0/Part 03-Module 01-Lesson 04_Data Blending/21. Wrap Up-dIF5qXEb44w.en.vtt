00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.730
In this lesson, we covered a number
of ways to blend data together

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.930
using really different approaches.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.070
We Unioned Multiple Data Sets
to create one longer data set,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.590
we Joined different files together
that had a Field in Common

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.660
to create a data set containing
fields from both sources.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.920
We used Fuzzy Matching to match together
two data sets with non-identical data.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.900
And lastly, we used Spatial Matching
to blend two sources of data together

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.049
using spacial components like points and
regions.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.610
As I mentioned in
the beginning of the lesson,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.482
we rarely get the data
we need in one file.

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:43.790
So it's really useful to know how to
blend data together, from whatever

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.450
sources you have at your disposal,
to create your final analytic data set.
