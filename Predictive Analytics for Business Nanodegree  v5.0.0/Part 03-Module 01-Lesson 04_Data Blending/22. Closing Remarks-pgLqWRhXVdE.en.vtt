00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.029
Over the span of this course,

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:06.430
we covered a number of steps to
building a great analytic data set.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.760
First, we discussed the different
structures of data out there.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.200
Then, we talked about
the various sources of data.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.651
Then, we reviewed data field formats.

00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:18.166
And why it's important for
fields to be in the optimal format for

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.080
their data type.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.230
Second, we reviewed a number of
data issues that we come across,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.840
like dirty data,
missing data, and outliers.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.540
Then, we covered how to deal with them.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.840
Third, we reviewed a number of ways for
reshaping our data, like transposing,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.210
aggregating, and cross-tabbing.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.704
And lastly, we looked at different
ways of blending our data together

00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:47.364
through unioning, joining,
fuzzy matching, and spatial matching.

00:00:47.364 --> 00:00:51.403
You are now prepared with a great
set of skills to build out robust,

00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:53.240
analytic dataset.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.530
Congratulations, at this point,
you're ready to move on to the project.
