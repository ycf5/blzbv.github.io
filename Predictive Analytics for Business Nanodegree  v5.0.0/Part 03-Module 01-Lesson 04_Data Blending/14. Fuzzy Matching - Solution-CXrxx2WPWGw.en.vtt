00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.620
How many business records
are duplicates of other businesses?

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.060
To Fuzzy Match the businesses,
we attach the Fuzzy Match tool, and

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.800
then we select the purge mode, since
we're dealing with jus one dataset.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.620
The ID field can be used as the record
ID, since it's unique to each record.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.650
How can we be sure of this?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.490
Well we can attach the unique tool and
see that no duplicates flow through.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.710
No records can make the D side and
all the records come out the U side so

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.390
they're all unique.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.230
Next we select the field that
contains the business names,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.110
which is called account holder,
and then select the match style,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.080
called company name as it
best fits with the data.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.470
Lastly, we add the unique tool after and
select ID and

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.540
ID2 to eliminate duplicate matches.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.860
There are three businesses that have
duplicates and they're identified here.
