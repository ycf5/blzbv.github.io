00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:04.133
If we look at the tool, we can see
that there are two data inputs.

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:10.020
One is T for target, these
are the trade areas for the stores.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.180
The other is U for universe and
these are the customer locations.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.140
The spatial object field for the target
is the trade area for the universe.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.960
It's the centroid of the customers,
the customer points.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.600
Next we select how we want the target
to interact with the universe.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.053
In this scenario we can choose
either Intersect or Contains and

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:37.329
it will return the same result.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.048
The trade area surface can both
intersect the point locations and

00:00:42.048 --> 00:00:46.520
the trade area surface can also
contain the point locations.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.990
Either of these options work for
this interaction.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.950
I'll stick with intersects.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.650
You can see below that when you do
a spatial match there is essentially

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.920
a join happening as the fields of the
two files can be output for each record.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.709
Let's run the workflow.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.600
We can see that for
each store we have a list of customers

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.680
that fall within the five
mile radius of that store.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.310
If we want to count up the customers
that fall in each store's trade area,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310
we can simply add in a summarize tool.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.370
We Group By on the storeID, and
simply count the number of customers.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.080
What we see is that there are four store
locations and here are the customers

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.300
that fall within those five mile
trade areas around the stores.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.340
However, you may have noticed
that there are actually six

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.070
store locations that were
brought into this operation.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.213
And so we actually find two records
that had no customers fall within

00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:58.900
the five mile trade area.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.989
So these come out the unmatched side.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.216
So store 5 and

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:08.750
6 did not have any customers fall
within their five mile radii.
