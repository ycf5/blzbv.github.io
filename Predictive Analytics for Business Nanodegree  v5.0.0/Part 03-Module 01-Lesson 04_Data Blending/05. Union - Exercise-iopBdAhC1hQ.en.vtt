00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.020
So we need to determine how many
records are in the appended data set.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.320
Let's first start by looking at
the data in the two input tools.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.600
The first data set has StreamNumber,
ID, firstName, and lastName.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.850
The second data set has the same fields,
but they're in a different order

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.370
with StreamNumber coming in first, and
then the lastName, firstName and ID.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.200
To append this data sets together,
we grab the Union tool and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.087
drop it next to the top data set.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
Then we manually create an arrow
connecting the lower data set.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.320
The default method is to
use Auto Configure by Name.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.680
So although the fields
are in a different order,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.200
when we run the work flow,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.642
they will be lined up because they're
lining up based on the field names.

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:56.071
[SOUND] We can see that we have
eight records total that come out of

00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:57.250
the Union tool.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.624
However, if you wanted to
count them using a tool,

00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:04.330
you could bring in the tool
called Count Records.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.830
I find it by searching on
the word count in the search bar.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.570
Find the tool called Count Records and
attach it to the Union tool.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.479
Then run the work flow to see
the total number of records, 8.
