00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
Now you're ready to tackle project one.

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:04.385
The data has been prepared already,

00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:06.335
so you can focus on the analysis.

00:00:06.335 --> 00:00:11.370
One data-set, contains the historical data that you use to build the model,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.290
and another file has the data to which you will apply the model and make a prediction.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.595
If you get stuck you have a handful of resources to help you.

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:21.350
First, check out the forums or slack chat room.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.550
You can find the links to the resources in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
the Welcome section in your classroom. Best of luck
