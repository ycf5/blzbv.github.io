00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.300
There a few key considerations
to consider when setting

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.460
up a randomized experiment.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.640
These are the unit of diversion,
population, duration and size.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.360
The unit of diversion refers to how you
will assign units to the control or

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.099
treatment groups.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.640
You could randomly assign each visit to
the site to either control or treatment.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.900
But then you may have the same user
seeing both versions of the site,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.800
which could be confusing to them, and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.850
complicate the interpretation
of the results.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.040
What most experiments do is try
to split units at the user level.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.130
So even if the user leaves the site and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.140
comes back,
they'll see the same version.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.150
This can be difficult with web data, but
most companies will use either a cookie,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.770
device ID, IP address or
some other identifier as a proxy.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.660
To learn more about the specifics of
how web experiments are designed,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.840
see the link to the lesson below.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.210
Next, you need to
determine your population.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.470
In our website example,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.750
this would be all visitors to the site
that don't already have the app.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.090
Next, you'll want to
select the duration and

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.300
size of experiment in a way that
ensures that your control and

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.990
treatment groups are representative
of your population.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.570
This is where the control
variables come in handy.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.310
Let's take a look back at the three
control variables we identified.
