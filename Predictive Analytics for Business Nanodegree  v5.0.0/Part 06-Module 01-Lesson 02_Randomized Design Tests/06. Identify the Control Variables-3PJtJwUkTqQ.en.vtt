00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's go into more details
of how we would control for

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.650
each of our control variables.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.890
For user characteristics, the analyst
would make sure that all types

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.310
of people have a chance to visit
the site during the experiment,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.550
not just those who shop in
the middle of the day, for instance.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.280
So the experiment would be run for
at least 24 hours, but most likely for

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.900
a whole week to capture visitors
who browse over the weekends.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.530
To control for

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.710
someone visiting the site more than
once, the analyst would want to

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.580
make sure that they were only counting
each individual person one time.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.378
This is where the proxy of an IP
address or a cookie would come in.

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:38.698
In the dataset you'll be using,
users are split at the IP level.

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:42.211
To control for users who already have
an account, the analyst would want to

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:45.690
remove all data from the analysis for
people who already have an account.
