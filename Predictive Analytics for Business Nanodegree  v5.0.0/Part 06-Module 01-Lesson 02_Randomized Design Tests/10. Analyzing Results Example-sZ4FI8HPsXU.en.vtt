00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.000
If you'd like to follow along, you can
find the data set in the Resources tab.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.120
You see here a small data set of
super heroes and super villains, and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
we're trying to make conclusions about
differences between the two groups.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.520
First, let's take
the average intelligence and

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.480
strength of both groups and
compare them.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.590
As you can see, it appears that villains
are quite a bit more intelligent,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.078
while heroes are stronger.

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:27.794
So now let's check the t-test results.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:32.210
You can do this in Excel
using the T-TEST function.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.610
This function has four fields.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.910
The two data arrays you're comparing,
whether the test is one or

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.090
two tails, and
what type of t-test you're using.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.710
For now, select the two-tail test and
an unequal variance test.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.630
You can read more about
these options below, but

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.120
we won't go into detail in this lesson.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.885
The formula will return a p-value.

00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:56.900
The p-value will tell you how likely
it is that the two means are in fact

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.210
the same, and that there is no
difference between the treatment and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.830
control groups.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.129
The closer the p-value is to zero,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.900
the more likely that the two
means are different.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.690
In this example, though the observed
difference in means seems large,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.040
the sample size is too small to result
in statistically significant results.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.551
You can see this clearly because
neither of the p-values are below 0.05.

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:23.224
In order to get to
statistical significance,

00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:25.630
you'd have to increase the sample size.
