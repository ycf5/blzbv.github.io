00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.590
Now that the data has been prepared for
analysis,

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.230
it's time to see what conclusions
we can draw from the experiment.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.068
Imagine you observe that the treatment
average is higher than the control

00:00:12.068 --> 00:00:12.644
average.

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:15.463
How can we be sure this
result wasn't random?

00:00:15.463 --> 00:00:19.586
In other words, how can we be sure that
the difference we see in the test,

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.100
actually exists in
the entire population?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.300
A randomized design experiment is
analyzed using a test of means analysis.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.710
A tests of means is a statistical
calculation of whether the mean values

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.390
of the treatment and
control groups are the same.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.830
Or, in other words, is there
a statistical difference in the results,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.179
or not?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.330
The first thing to look at,
is the target variable average for

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.170
both the treatment and control groups.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.360
This will give us an idea about
the magnitude of the impact

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.920
by the treatment.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.750
Similar to linear regression, a test
of means analysis included a T-test,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.440
which gives you a P-value.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.170
Just like in linear regression,
the P-value tells you the likelihood

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.820
that the actual difference
between the means is 0.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.606
Generally, if the P-value is below 0.05,
indicating a confidence interval of 95%,

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:16.819
the difference in means is considered
statistically significant.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.520
Using a T-test is especially important
when working with smaller datasets.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.210
Seemingly large differences in means
are much more likely the result

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.130
of random variation than small datasets.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.410
Let's take a look at an example.
