00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.920
Now that you understand
the basics of t-tests,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.380
let's continue with our analysis.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.960
To perform a test of means,
let's grab the test of means tool and

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.960
connect it to our data stream.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.870
Select Visit Flag for the response field
and Group as the group identifier.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.576
Now let's run the workflow
to look at our results.

00:00:19.576 --> 00:00:24.262
The p-value of 1.78 times 10 to
the minus 32 tells us that it

00:00:24.262 --> 00:00:28.060
is extremely unlikely that
the two means are the same.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.595
That's good news.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:32.085
So let's calculate
the difference in means.

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.005
First, we'll drag a summarize
tool onto the canvas,

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.035
connecting it to our data stream.

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:39.675
And let's count the number of
visits grouped by treatment or

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:42.785
control group and whether or
not they clicked on a link.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.795
Running the workflow,
we can see the results.

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:49.405
However, we want to see
the percent difference.

00:00:49.405 --> 00:00:53.190
We can easily do this a number of ways,
but let's continue to use Alteryx.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.170
We'll add a cross-tab tool,
grouping the data by the group field.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.110
The new column headers will be
visitflag, and the values for

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.630
the new columns will be Count.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.540
For the method of aggregation,
we'll select Sum and Percent row and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.740
then run the workflow again.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.200
Looking at the output, we see that
the percentage of users who clicked on

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.891
the link in the control
group was 18.59%.

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:22.520
In the treatment group,
it was 23.25%, a 4.66% jump.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.045
This result suggests that
the company can drive between 4 and

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:30.500
5% more users to click on the link to
learn more about the loyalty program

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.700
if they change the button on
the website to a picture of the app.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.940
It's now time to
communicate the findings.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.680
But first,
let's use a quiz to check your knowledge
