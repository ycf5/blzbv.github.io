00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.019
We've just completed the lesson
randomized design experiments.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.689
Let's review what we've
covered in this lesson.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.410
First, we provided an overview
of randomized design.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.490
Second, we discussed
the selection of variables for

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.049
the experiment, and then we covered
the design and setup of the experiment.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.030
Using the data that was gathered in
the experiment, we prepared the data for

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.030
analysis, and
then performed the analysis.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.100
And lastly, we discussed
the meaning of the analysis, and

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.994
created a sample presentation for
communicating the results.

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:37.505
Even though this was a shorter lesson,
we covered a lot.

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:40.025
You're now able to set up
randomized experiments, and

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:42.125
analyze the results to
determine business impact.

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:46.095
We're now ready to move on to
matched pair design experiments.
