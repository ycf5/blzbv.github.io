00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.470
In a randomized design experiment, units
are assigned randomly to treatment and

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.820
control groups.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.650
However, this doesn't mean that
there needs to be an equal

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.850
number of treatments and controls.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.900
You just have to make sure
the sample size is large enough, and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.950
the groups are representative
of the population.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.380
In the grocery store website experiment,
you'll see in the data

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.500
that each visit to the website is
randomly sent to one of three servers.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.760
The experimental website page
is displayed on server three,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.920
whereas the control website page is
displayed on servers one and two.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.210
In this case, we'd expect to see about
33% of the units in the treatment group,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
and 67% of the units
in the control group.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.750
At this point,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.200
we have everything we need- the unit
of diversion is the IP address.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.680
The population is all site
visitors without an account,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.350
the duration is one week.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.545
And the size is one-third of
the traffic to treatment units and

00:00:53.545 --> 00:00:55.680
two-thirds to control units.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.879
We can now hand over the experiment
design to be implemented on the site and

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:59.970
start collecting data.
