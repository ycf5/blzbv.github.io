00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.590
Here are the control
variables that I thought of.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.700
First, the type of people visiting the
page may have an impact as to whether or

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.370
not they will click on
the loyalty club link.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.680
Next, it would be important ensure
that we only count each person once

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.450
regardless of how many times
they click on the site.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.070
And lastly, whether or
not they already have a membership card

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.150
would likely influence
clicking on the link.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.590
Therefore, let's use the following three
variables for our control variables.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.840
The type of people visiting the page,
their socioeconomic standing,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.000
demographic profile, etc.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.240
How frequently they visit the site, and

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.040
if they already have
a membership number or not.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.100
We'll use this list as
an example going forward, but

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.620
think about how you would incorporate
the variables you thought up as well

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.340
as we walk through the rest
of the experiment.
