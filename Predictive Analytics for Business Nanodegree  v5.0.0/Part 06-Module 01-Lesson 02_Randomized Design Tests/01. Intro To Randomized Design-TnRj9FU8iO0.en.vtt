00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.260
Welcome to lesson 02 of AB testing.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.540
In this lesson, we'll walk through
the details of setting up, executing and

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.430
analyzing a randomized
design experiment.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.280
Remember from the previous lesson,
randomized design is a technique where

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.120
the treatment and control units
are selected completely randomly.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.750
This technique is used primarily in
situations where there's very little

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.840
opportunity to control variables,
and where the volume and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.180
velocity of data is high enough
that you're not worried about bias.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.310
Throughout this lesson, we'll walk
through the following experiment.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.660
Imagine that you're an analyst for

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.530
a large grocery chain, one of the
company's main goals is to drive more

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.300
customers to download their mobile app,
and register for their loyalty program.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.520
One way of driving customers
to download the app,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.100
is via a link on the company website.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.630
Page viewing statistics show that only
10% of people who visit the main page

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.090
are clicking through to visit
the page that describes the app, and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.710
loyalty program.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.240
Your manager has asked you to set up
an experiment to test whether changing

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.360
the button of the page link to a picture
would improve the click through rates of

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.760
visitors who visit the page that
describe the app and loyal to program.
