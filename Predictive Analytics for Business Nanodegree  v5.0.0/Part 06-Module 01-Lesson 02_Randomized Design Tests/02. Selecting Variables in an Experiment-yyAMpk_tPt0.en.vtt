00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.880
In the first lesson, we talked
about how to set up an experiment

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.180
by identifying the variables and
setting up treatment and control groups.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.960
In this problem,
you'll need to figure out whether or

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.940
not one of your customers clicked
on the link to download the App.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.980
Let's apply what you've
learned to your new task.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.990
The target variable, in this experiment,
is whether or not an individual clicked

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.630
on the link to visit the App and
loyalty information page.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.640
This is a binary target, yes or no.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.910
The experiment will compare the
difference in the click-through rate for

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.192
the control and treatment groups.

00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:37.245
A click-through rate measures
the percentage of people that click

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:38.377
on a link or visit a page.

00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:39.828
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:39.828 --> 00:00:43.480
The treatment variable is
which Web page they see.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.450
The treatment group will
see the modified page,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.030
and the control group will
see the original page.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.910
Control variables and random
experiments are used to ensure that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.250
both the treatment and control groups
are representative of the population.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.800
This helps give confidence,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.740
that if the change were applied
to the entire population

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.360
you could expect to see the same results
that you observe in the experiment.
