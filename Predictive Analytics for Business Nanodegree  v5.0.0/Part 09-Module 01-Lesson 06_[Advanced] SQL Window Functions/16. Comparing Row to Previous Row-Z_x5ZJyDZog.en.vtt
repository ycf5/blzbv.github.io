00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.115
It can often be useful to compare rows to preceding or following rows,

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.520
especially if you've got the data in order that makes sense.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.130
In this case, we're going to look at

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.390
how much standard paper each account has purchased over all time.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.140
We can see this in our inner query.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.460
Now, let's use LAG and LEAD to create columns that pull values from other rows.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.000
The syntax describes which column to pull

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.630
from and how many rows away you'd like to do the pull.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.375
LAG pulls from the previous rows,

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.405
and LEAD pulls from the following rows.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.995
As you can see, the first row of the LAG column is null

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:45.640
because there are no previous rows from which to pull.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.350
LAG value of the second column is zero.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.915
It's pulling from the standard sum value in the prior column.

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:56.945
This continues down through the rest of the data set.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:59.860
The LEAD column goes in the opposite direction.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.640
This can be especially useful for calculating differences between two rows.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.844
You can see that these new columns,

00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:58.470
now compare the standard sum to the prior and following rows.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:07.095
LAG difference shows the difference between the current row and the prior row.

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:12.000
LEAD difference shows the difference between the current row and the next row.
