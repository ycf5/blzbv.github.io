00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
If you're planning to write several window functions in the same query,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.340
using the same window,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.835
you can create an alias.

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:13.460
Let's use the previous example in which we tested a ton of different window functions.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.320
We'll define the alias using a window clause,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.675
which would normally go between the where clause and the group by clause.

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:22.800
Since this query has neither of those,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.600
we'll put this after from.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.750
As you can see the results are exactly the same,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.000
but the query is much easier to read.
