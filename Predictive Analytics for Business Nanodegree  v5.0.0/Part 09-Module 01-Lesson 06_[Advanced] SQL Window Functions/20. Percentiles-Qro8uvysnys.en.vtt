00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
The NTILE function allows you to see the percentile

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.925
or any other subdivision that a given row falls into.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.230
As you can see here,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.690
the number specified in the NTILE function is

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.955
the number of parts into which you'll divide the window.

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:15.110
One hundred means percentiles,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.715
five means quintiles, and four means quartiles.

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:23.760
In this case, order by determines which column to use to determine the quartiles,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.640
here using standard quantity.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.180
For each row, the NTILE four function will look at the value of standard quantity in

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.790
that row compared to all the other rows in

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.435
the window and then print the quartile that the value falls into.

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:43.960
So, a standard quantity of zero would fall in the first quartile,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.580
while the highest value would fall in the fourth quartile.
