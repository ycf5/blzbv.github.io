00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.620
In previous lessons, you imagined yourself as an operations manager,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.020
doing analysis to help with inventory planning.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.200
You looked at minimum, maximum,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.580
and average order sizes,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.055
to get a sense of what size order Parch and Posey

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:18.515
should be prepared to fulfill at any given time.

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:21.340
Really though, the best way to understand this,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.885
would be to look at percentiles,

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:25.310
to see where the most orders fall.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.000
We can do this with the NTILE window function.
