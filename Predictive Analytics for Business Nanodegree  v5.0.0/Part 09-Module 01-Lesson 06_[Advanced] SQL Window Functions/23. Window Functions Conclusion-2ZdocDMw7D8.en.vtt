00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.660
In this lesson, you've learned how to create windows and

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.440
use window functions for some pretty advanced analysis.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.765
These can take a little practice to really nail,

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.915
but can be extremely useful as you saw here.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.720
In the next lesson, you'll learn to join data in

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.030
advanced ways for situations where simple inner and left joins won't cut it.
