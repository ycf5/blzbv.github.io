00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
This lesson introduces one of the most powerful concepts in

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.751
SQL data analysis, the window function.

00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:12.315
It allows you to compare one row to another without doing any joints.

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:16.480
That means you want to do simple things like create a running total,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.820
as well as tricky things like determine whether

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.140
one row was greater than the previous row,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.915
and classify it based on your finding.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:27.095
Most people SQL education ends before this.

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:30.400
So, adding these skills to your toolkit and learning to use them in a number

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.030
of different situations will make you an extremely effective analyst.
