00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
We'll start with a query that returns the first order from each account.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.972
We're borrowing this directly from the earlier segment on subqueries.

00:00:07.972 --> 00:00:14.332
Now, let's join the web events full table using an inequality join.

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:34.777
You can see here that there are multiple conditional statements in the JOIN clause.

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:37.860
The first thing this query does is join events for which

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.580
the account ID matches the account ID from the orders table.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.830
Even when using inequalities and joins,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.435
you'll often have some type of equality to make sure the right results get joined.

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:52.530
The next line adds an additional filter using a less than operator.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.080
This works the same way that an equal sign works.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.320
Each row in the web events table is evaluated using

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.750
that statement and the rows that are evaluated to be true are joined.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.390
One thing to keep in mind is that it's a little bit harder to predict what the results

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.140
will look like when joining using inequalities.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.045
When joining the orders and accounts tables, for example,

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:14.550
it's pretty predictable there will be

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.655
at least one and probably many orders for each account.

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:21.110
Every order will have an account record that corresponds to it.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.300
But when figuring out whether there are web events that took place

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.735
prior to an accounts first order as we're doing here,

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:31.650
we have no guarantees about how these results should look.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.975
So the results won't give us any hints as to whether we've got the right query.

00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:40.490
It's worth double checking your query logic to make sure that doing the thing you want.
