00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
SQL has strict rules for appending data.

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:05.520
First, both tables must have the same number of columns.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.240
Second, those columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.835
Running each of these queries,

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.445
will individually show this to be true.

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:17.185
Here you can see four columns,

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:20.885
id, account_id, occurred_at, and channel.

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:23.890
And here, you can see those same columns with

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.765
the same names and same data types to make things easy for this example.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:31.475
While the column names don't necessarily have to be the same,

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:33.190
you'll find that they typically are.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.220
This is because most instances in which you'd want to use

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.995
UNION involve stitching together different parts of the same dataset.

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:43.870
One thing to note is, that UNION only appends distinct values.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.823
More specifically, when you use UNION,

00:00:46.823 --> 00:00:49.030
the dataset is appended and any rows in

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.930
the appended dataset that are exactly identical to rows in the first table are dropped.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.960
If you'd like to append all of the values from the second table, use UNION ALL.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.000
You'll likely use UNION ALL far more often than you use UNION.
