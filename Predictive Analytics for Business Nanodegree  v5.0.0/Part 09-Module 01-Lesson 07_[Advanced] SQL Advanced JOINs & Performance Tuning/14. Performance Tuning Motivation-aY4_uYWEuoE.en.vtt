00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
One place where SQL really excels,

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:06.255
is in it's ability to work with massive datasets.

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:07.845
To be more accurate,

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:10.845
modern databases can scale to work with huge amounts of data

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:14.670
and SQL is one of the most common and convenient ways to work with them.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.145
Even though databases are powerful,

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:20.945
you may still find yourself running queries that take hours to return.

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:24.720
In those cases, you want to take a little extra effort to write your queries

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.255
in ways that will allow the database to execute them as fast as possible.

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.620
In this section, you'll learn to identify when

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.080
your queries can be improved and how to improve them.
