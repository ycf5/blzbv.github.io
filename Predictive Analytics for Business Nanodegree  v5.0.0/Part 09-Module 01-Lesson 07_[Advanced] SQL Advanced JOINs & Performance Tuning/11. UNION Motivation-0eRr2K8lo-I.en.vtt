00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
Joins allow you to combine two data sets side by side.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.375
But sometimes, it's necessary to stack one on top of another.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.140
This might come in the form of several lists of events,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.475
email addresses, or anything else that might be stored in a few different places.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.250
Alternatively, you might want to append an aggregation,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.090
like a sum, to the end of a list of individual records.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.310
You can do this with a union.
