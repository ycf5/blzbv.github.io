00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
So far in this course,

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:07.690
we've only performed joins by exactly matching values from one table to another.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.995
There are plenty of cases where you might not want to join this way, though.

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:15.015
Let's put on our marketing manager hats again.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.720
In order to understand how effective our campaigns are,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.615
we want to look at all the actions that a customer took

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:25.620
prior to making their first paper purchase from Parch and Posey.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.350
To re-frame this, we want to look at all of

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.010
the web traffic events that occurred before that account's first order.
