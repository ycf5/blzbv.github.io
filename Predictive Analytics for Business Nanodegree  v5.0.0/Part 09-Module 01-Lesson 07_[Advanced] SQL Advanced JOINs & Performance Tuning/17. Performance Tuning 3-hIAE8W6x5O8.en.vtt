00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.585
You can add explain at the beginning of

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:07.090
any working query to get a sense of how long it will take.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.565
It's not perfectly accurate,

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:11.365
but it's a useful tool.

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:14.140
You'll get this output,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.805
which is called the query plan,

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:18.695
and it shows the order in which your query will be executed.

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:21.290
This is a pretty simple query plan.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.270
Let's add a limit and see how this changes.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.255
Since we know that the limit happens last,

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:33.610
you can get a sense of the order in which the query plan is executed.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.725
First, the filter is applied.

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:39.850
Then, the database reads the remaining rows and limits them,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.960
if applicable, to 100 rows.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.180
You can see this measure of cost listed next to the number of rows.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.520
Higher numbers means a longer run time.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.975
You should use this more as a reference than an absolute measure.

00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:56.905
To be clear, this is most useful if you run explain on a query,

00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:58.945
modify the steps that are expensive,

00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:01.090
then run explain again to see if the cost
