00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
In this last lesson,

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.410
we're going to cover more advanced joints and learn how to make

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.250
queries that run quickly even over giant data sets.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.767
Most of the work in this lesson is about covering edge cases.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.373
You're not going to use these functions day in and day out,

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:16.590
but when you need them,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.180
you'll be glad that you learn them.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.778
With these remaining skills,

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:21.515
you have a pretty complete toolkit.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.690
You'll certainly be ready for any analytics job that I've ever held.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.533
So without any further delay,

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.250
let's move on to the last lesson of this course.
