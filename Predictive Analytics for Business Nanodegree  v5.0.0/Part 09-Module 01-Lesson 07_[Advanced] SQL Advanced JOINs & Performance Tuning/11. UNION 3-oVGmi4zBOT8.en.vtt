00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
Once you union two select statements together,

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:04.410
you can perform operations on

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.545
the entire combined data set rather than just on the individual parts.

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:10.650
You can do this by unioning them together in

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.390
a subquery so the combined results are treated as a single result set.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.500
Here, we've taken the combined results from these two tables,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.635
and use them to count up all of the sessions by channel.

00:00:53.635 --> 00:00:56.260
A cleaner way to do this might be to do the union in

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.460
a common table expression and then do aggregations in the main query.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.000
As you can see, the results are the same but it's a lot easier to read the query logic.
