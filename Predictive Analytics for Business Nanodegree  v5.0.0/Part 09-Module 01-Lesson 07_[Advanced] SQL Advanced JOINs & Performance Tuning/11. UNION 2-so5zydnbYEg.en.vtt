Since you're writing two separate select statements when you union,

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:07.345
you can treat them differently before appending.

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:13.000
For example, you can filter them differently using different where clauses.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.610
These results show only rows where the channel is equal to

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.175
Facebook coming from demo.webevents.

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:30.360
These results show only rows from the Facebook channel for

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.670
the first event table where all rows from the events two table will be returned.
