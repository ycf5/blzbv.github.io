00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
Congratulations on completing this SQL course.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:05.790
If you had never used SQL before,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.575
you've come a really long way.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.690
From writing basic select statements,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.050
all the way to the tricky stuff that makes its way into interview questions,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.290
you're now more than ready to take on analytical problems.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.235
No matter what your industry or line of work.

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:20.880
The best thing you can do now,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.810
is go and apply these skills in the real world.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.120
Congrats and good luck.
