00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.540
Hi, my name is Patrick Nussbaumer and
I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.898
I work for Alteryx,
a leader in self-service data analytics.

00:00:09.898 --> 00:00:13.540
And have worked with data acquisition
and analysis for over 20 years.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.420
In this course,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.900
we'll be learning how to approach
a business problem using analytics.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.570
Let's talk about an example that we'll
reference throughout this course.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.260
Let's consider this scenario.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.020
You recently joined a multinational
firm that provides automated robots

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.210
that vacuum office spaces.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.570
For larger office spaces,
more robots are needed,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.110
and the software configuration to
run the robots becomes more complex.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.090
To support your clients, you have a help
desk that manages support tickets.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.440
Due to the nature of the business, it's
critical that the help desk is staffed

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.470
properly to ensure smooth operation
of the army of cleaning robots.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.400
Your manager has tasked you with
the following business problem.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.640
We're onboarding a new client next
month as part of a very large deal.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.220
It's critical that we support them
with our excellent service levels.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.930
I need to know how many tickets per
week on average we can expect from this

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.590
client so we can ensure we have
enough help desk resources in place.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.440
But before we attempt to solve this
problem, we need to spend some time

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.080
discussing how to approach business
problems with analytics and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.860
predictive models.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.511
First, we're going to
discuss a framework for

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.730
solving analytical problems.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.448
Second, we'll talk about
non-predictive data analysis.

00:01:24.448 --> 00:01:26.560
And third,
we'll return to our business problem and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.590
talk about predictive analysis, which
will lead us to review a process for

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.830
selecting the right predictive model.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.360
And lastly, we're going to discuss
linear regressions, which is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.012
the technique we'll use to solve our
support ticket business problem.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.110
All right, let's get going.
