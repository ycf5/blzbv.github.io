00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.740
An understanding of the data combined with

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.780
the business issue understanding will help you as you prepare the data for your analysis,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.650
which is the third step of the problem solving framework.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.120
When starting an analysis,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.980
it's a rare occasion for the data to be ready without some level of preparation.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.255
Preparing the data generally includes one or more of the following actions,

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:28.795
gathering, cleansing, formatting, blending and sampling the data.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.744
When gathering the data,

00:00:30.744 --> 00:00:35.015
you may need to collect data from multiple sources within your organization.

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.880
The data set you are working with may have issues that you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.570
want to resolve prior to your analysis.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.480
This can be in the form of incorrect or missing data.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.970
You may need to format the data by changing the way a date field appears,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.560
renaming a field, or even rotating the data.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.170
Similar to using a pivot table.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.655
You may want to blend or combine your data with

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.610
other data sets to enrich it with additional variables,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.175
similar to using the VLOOKUP lookup function in Excel.

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:04.460
And lastly, you may want to sample

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.115
the dataset and work with a more manageable number of records.

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:11.495
Referring back to our electricity example,

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:14.180
we identified that we may need to obtain some data from

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.005
the National Weather Service to get forecast high and low temperatures,

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.030
as well as historical temperature data.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.945
The data we obtain may not be in a usable format,

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:27.155
so we may need to prepare the data for analysis by formatting,

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.115
enriching and cleansing the data.

00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:34.115
We'll also gather data from our internal systems such as past electricity usage,

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:39.635
as well as any other data we may have that may prove useful to our analysis.

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:43.805
Maureen Wolfson has dedicated an entire course of preparing your data for analysis,

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:47.000
and will go into detail about the data preparation step.
