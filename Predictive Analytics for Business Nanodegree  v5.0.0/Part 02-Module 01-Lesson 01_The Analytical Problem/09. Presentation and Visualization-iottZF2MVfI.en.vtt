00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.190
Having completed a thorough analysis,
it's important to effectively

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.060
communicate the results to
the appropriate decision makers.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.730
The type of presentation, and
visualizations used, should be

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.319
determined based upon both the audience,
as well as the analysis itself.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.340
It's important to not just show up and
throw up, meaning that showing up

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.150
with positive data analysis is not the
best way to communicate your findings.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.760
In general, the best practice is
to tell a story about the data

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.360
that meets the needs of
the decision makers.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.869
Sometimes, especially with more
complex analyses, you may want to walk

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.596
the audience through the analytical
problem solving process used to perform

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:45.711
the analysis, emphasising the decisions
and assumptions you made along the way.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:46.699
For complex data,

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.910
visualizations are very helpful in
identifying trends in your data.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.430
For example, you may show a map to
illustrate that the electricity demands

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.840
vary by state,
as much as they do by temperature.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.105
Also, it's always very important to
reference the data sources you used.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:06.080
And finally, you can measure
the success of your analysis,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.540
if it supports the decisions
that need to be made.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.390
So there are the six steps to
the problem-solving framework.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.020
We'll be using this
throughout the course,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.600
to solve many different
business problems.
