00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.859
The first thing we're going to review,

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.420
is a framework that will help us
decide how to approach a problem.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.920
We're going to use a methodology
that was built initially for

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.200
data mining problems, but works well for
all types of business problems.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.750
This methodology is called the cross
industry standard process for

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.100
data mining, or CRISP-DM.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.840
The framework in this lesson is
generalized from the CRISP-DM

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.470
methodology, to work for
all types of business problems.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.370
Moving forward, we're going to call
this the problem solving framework.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.920
Let's start with a review of
the steps within the framework.
