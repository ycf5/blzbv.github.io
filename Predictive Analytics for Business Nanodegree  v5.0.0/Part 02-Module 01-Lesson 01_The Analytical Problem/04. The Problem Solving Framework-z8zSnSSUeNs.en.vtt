00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.380
The first step when approaching
any business problem

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.500
is business understanding.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.000
Some questions you can ask to help
understand the business issues are.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.140
What decisions need to be made?

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.180
What information is needed
to inform those decision?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.010
And what type of analysis can
provide the information needed

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.200
to inform those decisions?

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.170
Typically, developing a mental model of
the business issue helps a great deal

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.140
in structuring the potentially
relevant information

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.980
needed to perform the analysis.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.030
Let's review a specific business
problem to help illustrate

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.340
business issue understanding.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.000
How much electricity capacity does
a utility company need to supply for

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.330
any given hour tomorrow?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.450
First, let's discuss what
decisions need to be made.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.660
In this scenario,
we're looking to answer this question so

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.790
the organization can decide how
to supply the needed power.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.258
They'll need to predict whether or
not they'll have enough capacity.

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:03.780
So they can determine which
plants they can bring online or

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.190
if they need to purchase
electricity in the marketplace.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.190
The critical information
that needs to be known

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.740
is how much electricity will be demanded
in each hour of the day tomorrow.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.950
Unfortunately, this information is not
known at the time decisions need to be

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.760
made.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.440
So the demand for each hour
tomorrow needs to be predicted.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.540
Which will allow the company to make
appropriate decisions about what

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.980
plants to turn on and if they'll need
to buy extra electricity or not.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.170
Therefore, we know that we need
a predictive analysis to help us obtain

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.930
the data to inform
the decision we need to make.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.210
We don't have enough information at this
point to know the type of predictive

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.480
analysis without a better understanding
of the data that is needed and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.620
the data we have available.
