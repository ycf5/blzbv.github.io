00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
Project Zero is a simple example of how to apply

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.403
the results of a predictive model to help make a decision.

00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:07.995
We'll come back to this project later,

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.105
and you'll have a chance to build a model yourself

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:12.960
and even improve it with the skills you learn in the first course.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.685
In the next segment,

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:17.670
you'll learn a useful framework for taking a business problem,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.331
from problem definition to presenting results.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.679
You'll also learn the all important skill of

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.736
selecting the right model or methodology for a problem.

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:28.589
And lastly, you'll dive into linear regression models.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.865
For the project, you'll be given a business problem and some data.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.594
You'll go through the problem solving framework on your own,

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:37.109
build a linear regression model,

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.060
and then use the results to provide a recommendation.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.765
Take a look at the project overview and description before you go through the course.

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:48.000
It will give you a good sense of the goal of the course. Good luck.
