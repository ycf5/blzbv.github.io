00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.980
Before any business
problem can be solved,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.020
it's important to know what data is
needed, and what data's available.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.590
The second step in the framework
is understanding the data.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.940
Having a mental model of the business
issue will be helpful in determining

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.980
what factors are likely
to drive demand tomorrow.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.350
For example, some factors that
are likely to be important

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.830
are the day of the week,
as well as the month and the year.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.670
It'll also to be useful to
know the hour of the day and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.660
the temperature at that hour, and
maybe even the preceding hour.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.400
So we're trying to predict
electricity usage, but

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.930
don't know what the temperature
will be tomorrow.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.690
We'll need to make predictions about
the temperature at any given hour.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.650
Now that we have some ideas around our
data needs, we can start to explore data

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.320
factors that will help us
predict hourly temperatures.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.435
In this scenario,
we may look at the forecasted high and

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:53.307
low temperatures from
the national weather service.

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:56.479
The number of minutes from
sunrise to start of each hour,

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.730
and the temperature for
the same hour of the previous day.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.599
The available data will be important
citing the types of methodologies that

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.250
may be used.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.870
Additionally, a solid understanding
of the data is important

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.030
to ensure proper analysis.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.495
For example, if you have a data field
that shows the number of employees per

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:18.795
month, it may be important to know if
the value represents the number of

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:21.837
employees at the beginning of the month,
at the end of the month.

00:01:21.837 --> 00:01:24.563
Or, the average of the number of
employees at the beginning and

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:26.170
end of the month.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.910
An improper understanding of the data
may result in an incorrect analysis.
