00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.830
To validate our analysis,
we have multiple statistical values

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.100
that we can use to determine
the quality of our solution.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.990
However, it's important to
view all results within

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.460
the context of our business problem.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.790
Let's go back to our example.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.050
We may have started trying to predict
the temperature based upon historical

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.900
temperatures alone.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.120
And after generating a predictive model,
we discovered,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.440
through validation,
that historical temperatures alone

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.130
are not the best predictors
of future temperatures.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.490
Therefore we have to go back to
the analysis modeling step, and

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.810
change our model.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.980
For example, we may try to add
an additional factor to our model,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.350
such as the forecasted temperature, or
we may try a new approach all together.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.240
Many times you'll go through
an iterative process

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.040
while building a predictive model
that you have confidence in.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.680
It's imperative not to throw all of
your data at a model and hope for

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.390
a decent outcome.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.900
The best models are those that
are created with methodical analysis.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.780
In some cases,
you may need to start the entire problem

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.000
solving process over again and
revise some of your assumptions and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.370
decisions based upon what you've
learned during the process.
