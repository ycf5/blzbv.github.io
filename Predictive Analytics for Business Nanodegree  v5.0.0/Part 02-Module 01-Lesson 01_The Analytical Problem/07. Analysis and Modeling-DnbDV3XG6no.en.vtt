00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.190
After the data is prepared, the next
step is to perform the analysis and,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.040
if appropriate, model the problem.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.260
There are a number of different methods
available for performing the analysis.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.940
In the next lesson of this course,
we'll go into detail on how to select

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.350
the methodology and modeling method
that is best suited for your scenario.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.120
Let's use our electricity example
to elaborate on this step.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.710
Earlier, in the problem
solving framework,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.180
we determined that we needed
to predict the temperature for

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.850
the next day using some of
the factors we identified.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.629
And then, we are going to predict the
electricity usage using the predicted

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.040
temperature as well as other factors.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.570
So we start by building
out a predictive model

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.560
that helps us predict
the temperature for the next day.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.410
We have identified a number of
factors that may be good at predicting

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.510
temperature.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.930
But we'll start with one to
create our initial model and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.740
learn during the process.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.533
Once we have created our first model,
we'll validate it and

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:59.760
then determine if we need to update
the model with additional information.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.755
Once we have a model that we can
confidently predict temperature with,

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:06.760
we'll repeat the process to
predict electricity usage.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.160
After creating a model that
we're comfortable with,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.020
one that predicts electricity usage for

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.930
a given hour on the next day,
we need to perform our analysis.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.650
This may include the number of
electricity plants that we need for

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.440
any given temperature, as well as
the thresholds when we need to activate

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.590
additional plants or
purchase electricity on the market.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.610
We'll probably perform
the analysis step multiple times

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.000
until we have confidence
in our analysis.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.500
So let's discuss how we get the level
of confidence that we need.
