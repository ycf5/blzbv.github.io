As I mentioned earlier,
data can come from a variety of sources.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.852
But we can generally bucket them
into computer files, databases and

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:10.680
web-based sources.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.230
Files can be created from applications,
like Microsoft Excel or Access.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.000
From mapping software,
like MapInfo or ArcGIS.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.510
From predictive software,
like SAS or SPSS.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.800
Or even just text files in CSV format.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.560
We'll explore databases and web-based
sources in the upcoming sections.
