00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.910
Let's dive into common field types
that we'll find in data, and

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.140
get to know them a little bit better.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.320
Generally, they can be
put into five categories.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.090
Strings, numeric data, date/time,
boolean, and special objects.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.910
Strings are any kind of characters,
alpha numeric, including symbols.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.250
Some examples can be an address field,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.860
a state code, an open-ended survey
response, or a product description.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.820
Numeric data are numbers which can be
whole numbers, such as integers, or

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.539
numbers with decimal places.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610
Some examples are sales and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.345
dollars, population in a trade area
around a store, or an age of a person.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:49.990
Date/time type data can
contain a specific date, or

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.860
a combination of both date and time.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.560
This data can really be handy for
calculating the number of minutes

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.688
before a caller reporting a problem and
its resolution.

00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:04.650
The boolean type is sometimes
also called a logical type and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.660
is a conditional flag representing
either true or false.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.010
And then there are special objects,
which can be objects such as images,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000
maps, report objects, and
sound files, to name a few examples.
