00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.210
Now our boss wants us to
know which customer segment

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.140
makes up the most of
our Denver customers.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.270
We can do this easily by summarizing our
data on the Customer Segment field and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.050
counting up the records in each segment.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.306
To do this, we'll use the Summarize tool
and drop it next to the Filter tool.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:25.082
Then we'll click on the Customer Segment
field &amp;gt; Add &amp;gt; Group Buy.

00:00:25.082 --> 00:00:27.180
Now, the data will be
grouped by segment.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.400
Next, to count up the records,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.568
we'll go back to Add, select Count,
then, we'll run the work flow again.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.380
The results shows us
four customer segment

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.800
types with the number of
customers in each segment.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.900
While it's pretty easy to see
the segment that contains the most

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.510
customers, imagine this list
had 10,000 records in it.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.870
The way to find the top
segment by counts of customers

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.060
would be to sort the data.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.330
To do that, let's grab the Sort tool
next, attach it to the Summarize tool.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.920
Then we'll select the Count
field under name, and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.350
set the order to be descending.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.850
When we run the workflow again,
we can see that the customer segment,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.759
corporate, has the most customers
at has the most customers at 390.
