00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.690
Analytics, and
the results from our analyses,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.860
are only as good as the data
that you have to work with.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.310
But not all the data that you have
available to you is easy to use.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.190
Data could come from many sources,
there's transactional data,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.790
like what's recorded at
the supermarket for every purchase.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.290
Data captured from devices we use,
like our TV, cable boxes, or

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.990
cellphones, and collected data like
weather, census, or flight data.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.170
As you work with data to
solve analytical problems,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.320
your challenge will be to think about
how you can use all the data available

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.980
to you to make your analyses as rich and
powerful as possible.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.440
But now you might be thinking, how can
I integrate social media reviews or

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.510
survey results into my analysis if
it's just a big paragraph of words?

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.720
How could I make sense of
the chaos in the data?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.500
To the answer these questions,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.710
we need to first understand
the structure of data.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.283
Data falls into one of three categories,
structured,

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:05.610
unstructured or semi-structured.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.480
Coming up, we'll look a little
further into each of these

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.170
three ways that data is structured.
