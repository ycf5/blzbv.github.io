00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.330
Structured data, or
data with a high degree of organization.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.525
They are typically organized into to
columns and rows, like in a spreadsheet.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.520
Sometimes columns are also
called fields, and

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.650
rows are referred to as records.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.243
And these terms may end up being used
interchangeably, throughout the course.

00:00:18.243 --> 00:00:22.860
Each column represents a variable, and
each row represents a record of data.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.595
Structured data is often
stored in databases or files,

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:31.658
such as spreadsheets, and
it's usually easily accessible.

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:34.310
But, most importantly, it's easy to use.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.670
Unstructured data, however,
can have no structure to it at all.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.640
Since the data isn't organized into a
typical columns or rows format, it could

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.370
be time consuming to work with, as you
have to pull what you want out of it.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.755
Some examples of this type of data are a
resume, a tweet or a contract document.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:59.880
Semi-structured data is data that
has some structure to it, but

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.319
still requires some work to put it into
a structure format of columns and rows.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.440
This could be a computer system
log file that requires parsing and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.190
manipulating, to put into a format
that makes the data easier to analyze.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.906
Another example could be a catalog
of music CDs in an XML file,

00:01:19.906 --> 00:01:24.769
where you can clearly see a structure,
with each CD having a TITLE,

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:28.437
Artist, COUNTRY, COMPANY,
PRICE and YEAR, but

00:01:28.437 --> 00:01:32.047
it's not in the typical columns and
rows format.

00:01:32.047 --> 00:01:36.370
So it still needs a bit of work, to get
in to a format that can be easily used.
