00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.270
There are two main reasons
why data types are important.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.760
When doing calculations across multiple
fields and when blending data sets.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.800
First, it's important when
doing any kind of calculations.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.770
Let's take multiplying two fields
of data together as an example.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.500
Multiplication assumes that we're
working with numeric fields, so

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.390
both of the fields need
to be number types.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.830
Next if we're going to blend two data
sets together, we need the field or

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.590
fields that we're joining on
to be the same data type.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.660
For instance, if we have a customer
file and a transaction file, both

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.750
with the CustomerID field, we can join
these files together using this field.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.620
This would result in fields from
the customer file being appended

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.870
to each of the transaction records.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.330
However, if the CustomerID field in one
file is a string and the CustomerID

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.020
field in another file is a number,
we'll have difficulty joining the data.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.340
Depending on the software you're
using to join the data sets,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.650
error messages may appear.
