00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.115
Hi, I'm Maureen and I work as a Solutions Engineer at Alteryx.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:07.125
I'll be your instructor in this course,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:11.875
where you'll learn how to build a really great dataset to fuel your analytics.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:16.710
For years, I've been helping customers create analytic datasets for their analysis,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.320
and what I've learned along the way is that you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.350
rarely get one dataset that's in perfect shape,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.015
totally clean, and has no issues.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:28.140
To be honest, a lot of time can be spent working

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.290
to get a dataset just right before it's analyzed.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.170
But why spend the effort?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.880
Well, we've often heard the term garbage in, garbage out,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.465
and well, your analytics will only be as good as the data you feed it.

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:46.545
In this course, you'll learn techniques used to prepare datasets for analysis.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.090
By the end of the course,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.550
you'll apply these techniques to produce a robust analytic dataset.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.060
These skills will be used throughout the rest of the course and are

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.720
key skills used by business analysts in their jobs every day.
