00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
The course will be divided up into four lessons;

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.805
understanding data, data issues,

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.330
data formatting, and data blending.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.330
First, we need to get an understanding of the various types of data out

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.320
there and why it's important to have your data formatted correctly.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.520
Second, we'll look at problems we may encounter when working with data.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.515
You may have dirty data, missing values,

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:28.060
or even outliers which are values that are way different from the majority of the data.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.415
We'll learn how to identify these issues and what to do about them.

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:36.115
Third, we'll look at different methods we can use to format our data,

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.675
so it's most useful.

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:40.760
Often, we don't get data exactly in the format that we

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.850
need to use and we might need to reorganize it.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.105
We'll address how to do that in this section.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:51.890
Lastly, we'll look at blending data together from disparate data sets as we

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.675
will rarely have all the data we need for our analysis in one file.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:58.495
At the end of the course,

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.280
you'll have gained an understanding in how to build

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.369
a great analytic dataset and along the way,

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.960
have picked up the skills and all tricks to do so.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.010
However, the principles you'll be learning here

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.295
apply beyond to just using Alteryx software.

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:18.650
You'll be learning skills that you can apply to whatever analytic software you choose.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.800
Along the way, we'll demonstrate how Alteryx can

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.890
be used to perform many different operations.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.670
There are tons of Alteryx training resources you can use outside of

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.500
this course to help you get up to speed if you're struggling or just want to learn more.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.000
