00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.350
We're going to take a little break from
the lesson to become a bit more familiar

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.670
with Alteryx.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.280
Since we'll be using Alteryx for a good
part of this course to demonstrate how

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.270
to build an analytic data set,
let's explore some basic capabilities so

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.190
that when you go to use it, you're
a little more comfortable with the tool.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.860
We're first going to get familiar
with how to bring data into Alteryx.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.320
To start, I'm going to simply
click on the Input Data tool, and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.280
drop it onto the canvas.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.470
Next I'll click over to
the Configuration window, and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.170
then to the drop-down arrow,
and choose File Browse.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.840
From here you can see the various file
types supported by the Alteryx software.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.185
Next I'm going to navigate to where
the sample data is located for

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:44.580
Alteryx, choose a file,
click on Open, and

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.670
then choose the sheet that
says Output$ and then OK.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.520
We can see the data on the left
in the preview window, and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.030
the file is now opened in Alteryx.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.050
Now that we know how to open a file in
Alterxy, let's look at a few additional

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.410
functionalities that will allow us
to explore the data file further.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.050
Let's practice building
a work flow in Alteryx.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.000
Let's say your boss asks you to tell her
how many customers are in the Denver

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.390
market.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.000
As a start, it'd be interesting to know
how many records total are in the file.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.740
This can be done really easily
by simply running the work flow.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.350
We do this by clicking
on the Play button, or

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.800
hitting Ctrl+R on the keyboard.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.640
Once the workflow is run,
we can navigate to the Results window,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.010
click on the Messages icon, and see that
2669 records were read in from the file.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.990
By clicking on the Output icon, we can
see the data and the fields in the file.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.160
But our boss is only interested
in analyzing the customers

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.730
who are in Denver.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.910
We can use the Filter tool to isolate
these customers out of the larger data

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.010
set.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.690
We pull the Filter tool
onto the canvas and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.000
select the City field
in the Basic Filter.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.870
In the box to the right of equals,
we enter Denver.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.500
The Filter tool has two outputs, a T,
or true, side and an F, or false, side.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.900
The true side outputs the records where
the expression evaluated to true.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.690
So these are the records
where the city is Denver.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.099
There are 1166 records in that list.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.724
If you click on the false side,
you can see the rest of the records for

00:02:22.724 --> 00:02:23.750
the other cities.
