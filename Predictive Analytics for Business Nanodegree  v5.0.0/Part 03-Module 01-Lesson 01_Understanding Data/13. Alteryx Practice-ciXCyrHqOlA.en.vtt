00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.760
To identify which stores have
more than 300 customers,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.850
we need to count the customers
by store number.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.630
To do this, we add the Summarize
tool after bringing in the file.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.600
Next we click on the Store Number,
click on Add and

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.720
then Group By, and then again on Count.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.410
When we run the workflow,
a count has been added to each store.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.420
Next, we connect the filter tool and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.960
set the expression to
count greater than 300.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.640
Five records come out of the true side,
so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.547
five stores have more
than 300 customers.
