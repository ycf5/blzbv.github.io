00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.790
We mentioned earlier that when making
calculations, it's important to

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.920
understand the data types in the fields,
so you can avoid running into errors.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.448
Using Alteryx, we'll look at field
types in our files and change them so

00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:15.462
that a calculation can be made.

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:20.330
We're going to start with a file from
the Alteryx samples directory called

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.094
statepopulatons.csv.

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:27.170
CSV files contain a series of
strings separated by commas.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.450
So when opened in Alteryx, each of the
fields will be these string field types.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.330
I'd like to create a new field
that is the population density

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.380
per area square mile.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.230
As you can see, we have an Area field,
and we have a Total Population field.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.200
So to make this calculation,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.190
we're simply going to divide
the population by area.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850
If we try to do this without
changing the data types,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.910
these fields will get an error message.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.210
I'll attach the Formula tool, and create
the new field, called Pop Density.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.370
Then, to create the formula to
calculate the Population Density,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.010
I'll select the population,
divide that by area square miles.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.040
When I do this,
I immediately get an error message,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.390
saying formula try to apply
numeric operator to string value.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.170
We can't divide or
do arithmetic on string fields.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.070
We'll need to change the field
types from strings to number.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.710
To do this I'm to going to introduce
two methods using the Select tool and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.620
the Auto-Field tool.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.345
First, to use the Select tool,
we're going to drop it on the line

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:42.120
in-between the File Input and
the Formula tool.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.930
From here, we're going to change
the area square miles and

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.550
the total population to numbers.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.930
Because the area square miles
has decimal places in it

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.400
we can choose a double for this value,
which can handle decimals.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.780
The Total Population field
is a whole number, so

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.610
we'll select int64, which is an integer.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.850
The field types are explained in
great detail in the help in Alteryx,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.180
which you can bring up by simply
hitting F1 on the keyboard,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.550
while the Select tool is active.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.600
Now if we run our workflow,
the Formula tool will work.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.960
And a new field with our
Population Density will be populated.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.540
To bring this new field up,
we simply click on the anchor

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.170
at the end of the Formula tool and
the new field will be shown below.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.250
Another way to change field types is
an alternative to the Select tool,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.840
by using the Auto-Field tool.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.200
If you had too many
fields in your file and

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.640
you didn't want to manually change each
one, you could use the Auto-Field tool.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.760
As it can change all of
the string fields automatically

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.520
to the most appropriate field
type that fits with its data.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.805
You can find it by searching for
Auto-Field in the search bar,

00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:00.360
connected to the Input File,
and simply run the workflow.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.590
You won't notice anything
different in the data, but

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.570
if you do click on the Metadata over

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.300
here on the left, you'll notice that
the field types and sizes have changed.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.720
So these are the types and
sizes for the output.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.420
These are the field types and
sizes for the input.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.690
Notice how they all
started as vstring254, and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.350
they became a variety of
different sizes and formats.
