00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.240
Here's an example of how you can
web scrape the top doctors list.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.270
In Alteryx,
we'll bring in the text input tool, and

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.750
paste in the URL for
the top doctors list.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.370
Then we'll attach the download tool to
it, and attach a browse tool to the end,

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.230
so we can view the data that comes out.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.550
In the download tool,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.830
we point the URL field to
the field that contains the URL.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.100
We only have that one field.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.965
Once we run the workflow,
we can expand the download data cell.

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:34.385
So, we can see the data
coming through for the page.

00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:39.155
We can see all this extraneous data
that we don't need up top, but

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:42.185
as we scroll down we'll
see the desired data.
