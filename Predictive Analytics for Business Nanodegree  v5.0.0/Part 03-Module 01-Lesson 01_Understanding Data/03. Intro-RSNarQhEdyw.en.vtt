00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.560
In this lesson,
we're going to think outside of the box

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.020
in terms of all the data that
we can use in our analytics.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.520
We'll also look into the format of data,
and why it's important for

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.185
it to be in the most
efficient format possible.

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:22.934
[SOUND] By the end of a lesson, we'll
be able to input a data into Alteryx,

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:26.330
recognize its structural

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.404
optimize the field types
to best fit with our data.

00:00:30.404 --> 00:00:31.490
Let's dive in.
