00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.969
To bring data from a database in Altrex,
simply click on the Input Data Tool and

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:06.364
drop it onto the canvas.

00:00:06.364 --> 00:00:10.299
Next we click over to
the Configuration Window.

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.587
And then to the drop down arrow and
choose Database Connection.

00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:18.533
You'll need to know the proper way to
connect to your database, whether it

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:24.210
be an all ADB driver, an all DBC driver,
or a direct connection to Oracle.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.316
In this example,

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:29.310
we're going to connect to SQL
server using an all ADB connection.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.521
The first thing I do is
select the all ADB driver for

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:38.070
SQL server, and
then I enter the server name.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.243
Next I select the security
used to log in to the server.

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:45.818
In my case, I'm using Windows integrated
security, so I select this, and

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:49.780
then I can select the database
from the drop down.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.836
I'm going to select from the master
database and test the connection.

00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:58.621
So the connection succeeded and
we're good to go.

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:04.220
Once we click on OK, I can pull
the data using several common methods.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.592
So I'm pulling in all the data
from the transactions table,

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:11.945
taking a look at the query
in the query editor.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:16.244
Test the query and click on OK.

00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:18.942
At this point,
my connections been made, but

00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:22.410
the data can't be shown until
I hit the Update Sample link.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.920
And so now, all of the data is shown,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.951
at least the first hundred
records in my file.

00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:33.442
If I want to see all the data I
can bring in the browse tool,

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:38.320
run the workflow, and this is all
of the data from my data set.
