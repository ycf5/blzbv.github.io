00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
So, now you have some experienced building and using a linear regression model.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.580
In your last project,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.145
the data was prepared for you.

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:10.820
However, there's often a lot of work that goes into gathering,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.535
cleaning, and blending data before it's ready for analysis.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.790
Data preparation is absolutely crucial for business analysis.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.165
Without good data prep,

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:23.320
the results of your analysis can be incorrect or misleading.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.070
For example, while I was working as a consultant,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.350
I was building a model to estimate the price of

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.015
a stock based on movements in marketing industry indices.

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:34.820
It was pretty late in the process when my colleague pointed out that the stock price was

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.930
listed it as negative on some days which totally threw everything off.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.445
After making the changes,

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:43.365
the results of my analysis made much more sense.

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:44.685
In this next section,

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:46.820
we will discuss various aspects of preparing

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.690
data including how to avoid mistakes like Sam's.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.510
You learned about different data sources and data types,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.045
how to deal with common data issues like missing data and outliers,

00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:58.730
how to format data,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.070
and how to blend data from different sources.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.570
Take a look at the project overview and description before you go through the course.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.780
It will give you a good sense of the goal of the course. Good luck.
