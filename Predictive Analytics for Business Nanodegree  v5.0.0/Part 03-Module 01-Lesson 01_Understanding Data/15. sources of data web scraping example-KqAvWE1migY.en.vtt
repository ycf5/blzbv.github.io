Pulling data from a flat file stored on
the Internet is fairly straightforward.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.380
You download the file, then open it
like you do any other flat file.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.300
Web scraping can be a bit
more difficult, though.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.390
Let's look at an example
of web scraping.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.980
The link found below the video
is to a magazine article

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.980
that lists top doctors in
the Denver metro area.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.590
In order to pull the data about
each of the doctors off this page,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.560
we'll have to scrape
the data from the website.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.590
Web scraping is done by making a request
to a website and getting data back.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.540
By typing in a URL, or a web address,
a request is made of a web server.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.320
In response, it returns the web code
which contains the data from that page.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.840
This code is called HTML,
Hypertext Markup Language.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.640
Which is the most common
web coding language.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.760
The data that we want to extract from
the code is embedded within the text and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.450
needs to be parsed out into rows and
columns.
