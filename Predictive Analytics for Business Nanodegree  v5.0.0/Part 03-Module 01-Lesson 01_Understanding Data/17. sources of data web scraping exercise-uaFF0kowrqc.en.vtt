00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.140
To pull the data from
the Alteryx Ace program's website,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.320
we start with a text input tool.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.550
Enter the URL of the page,
and enter the field URL.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.170
Next we connect the download tool,
and add a browse tool after that.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.930
When Alteryx is run we can see
the results in the download data cell.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.160
We can expand the size of the window to
see the data in this download data cell.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.130
This cell contains the entire webpage.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
To output this to a CSV
file we then connect

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.720
the select tool first to remove the two
extraneous fields that don't contain

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.690
the data from the webpage,
URL and Download Data Headers.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.850
Then we connect up the output data tool,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.790
select a file,
enter a file name for the CSV file.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.210
Click Save, make sure the file
type is listed as CSV.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.520
And then be sure to change
the delimiter, from a comma to /0.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.820
Which indicates no delimiter.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.880
And make sure that the option 4
First Row Contains Field Names,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.130
does not contain a check.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.265
When we run the workflow,
the file would be created.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:21.496
[SOUND] If we click on the file,

00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:26.403
it will be opened up in the tool that

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:30.482
opens CSV files by default.

00:01:30.482 --> 00:01:31.790
And we can see the output.
