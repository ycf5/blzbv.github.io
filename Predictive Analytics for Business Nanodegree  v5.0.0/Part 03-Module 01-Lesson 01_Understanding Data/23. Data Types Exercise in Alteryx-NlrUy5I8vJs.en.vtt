00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.380
Bring in the file transactions.xml.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.240
If we run Alteryx, you'll notice
the sales field is a string and

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.850
not a number.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.320
We go over to the metadata and
we can see the types here.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.480
If we need to sum the sales field,
it needs to be in a numeric format.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.060
So using the select tool, we'll change
the sales field to a number format,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.610
say, double.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.250
Then we add a summarize tool,
group by order ID,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.130
sum the sales field, and
when we run our Alteryx,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.670
we see the result, but
if we want to find the total sales for

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.920
order number 10080,
we need to add a filter tool next.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.910
After adding the filter tool,
we isolate the order ID to 10080,

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.730
and let's see what the result is.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.786
So the result is 637, or if you used

00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:03.852
a double or decimal, 637.04.

00:01:03.852 --> 00:01:05.458
