00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.300
We have just done all the hard work,
and now we can just sit back, relax and

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.250
let our beautiful model do all the work.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.650
We're now up to the easy
part of our analysis,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.309
what we're going to do is use our
historical model to predict the future.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.640
The first thing we're going to do,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
is output our model object that we're
going to use to then score our data set.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.872
We don’t have to do this, but I just
think its best practice to output this,

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:31.325
so we don’t have to run the logistic and
the stepwise model over and over and

00:00:31.325 --> 00:00:32.800
over again.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.840
So they only thing we need to do
is bring in an output data tool,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.820
connect it to the model object
that we want to output, and

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.970
then name this model and
save it off to a certain location.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.280
So what I'm going to do is just
call it MOD for model object, OBJ.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.172
And then I'll call it step at the end.

00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:58.310
It's going to be saved off
as a YXDD type of format.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.250
Let me run this model.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.430
And then after this,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.450
what I want to do is open up a blank
canvas and input that data set.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.830
So I'm bringing the input data tool,
and input my model object.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.228
What I'm also going to bring in is
the data set that I want to score.

00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:18.700
So that's going to be our exact same
data set we read in to the build

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.540
the former model on, but not broken out
into estimation and validation samples.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.440
I still need to make my
manipulations with the select tool

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.690
to make sure we have the correct
field types for our different values.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.520
Now lastly, what I want to do is I
want to bring in that score tool.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.780
The score tool needs no
real configuration, and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.910
you can plug in your model object and
your data set into either side.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.690
What we're going to do now is bring
in a browse tool and run this model.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.890
If you look at the output
with the score tool and

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.600
the browse tool, we're able to see that
we have a predictive probability that

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.160
that individual will not respond, or
will respond to this marketing campaign.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.000
As you can see,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.570
these first individuals are very
likely to redeem a future offer.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.250
While these individuals are not very
likely to redeem a future offer.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.120
So let's think about this.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.710
What we were just able to do is
determine the predictive probability to

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.188
redeem an offer for
every single individual.

00:02:22.188 --> 00:02:23.995
Now that we've completed
the modeling and

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:27.520
scoring, it is time to report
our findings over to the boss.
