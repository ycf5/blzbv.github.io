00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670
We'll spend some time talking about how to prepare data for modeling,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.515
and now we're going to shift to the fun stuff and focus on building out models.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:09.675
In this lesson, we're going to be building out

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.525
binary classification models in particular.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.555
We're going to start off by discussing two types of models;

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.910
logistic regression and decision trees.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.850
Then we're going to talk about model comparison which helps us

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.180
figure out which of the two models fit the data best.
