00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:04.689
We have chosen a model so
the only thing we have to do is predict

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.520
who is going to redeem
a future marketing campaign.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.500
When we put a model into production,
it's referred to as scoring a model.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.790
This simply means taking
each individual record and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.140
applying the model to them, which gives
their probability to redeem this offer.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.610
Now I'm going to have you
take a stab at this first,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.990
with our completed model, and
one individual to predict.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.100
Then we're going to take the full
data set and score it over in Altrex.
