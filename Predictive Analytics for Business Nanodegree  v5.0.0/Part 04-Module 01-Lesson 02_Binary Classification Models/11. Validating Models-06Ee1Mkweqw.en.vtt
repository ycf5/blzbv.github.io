00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.490
Now that we've built out a model,
I think we're ready to start

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.870
validating our model against
an independent dataset.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.740
What we're going to look for
is a couple of things.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.140
One, what is the overall
accuracy of the model?

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.350
Meaning, if we place a person from
the validation sample through our model,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.249
did that person get labeled as
the correct redeemer status?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.930
Next, I'm looking for a trend in
the wrong predictions such as,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.510
is there a trend for
way more yes values than no?

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.960
So, let us validate the model
over an Alteryx now.
