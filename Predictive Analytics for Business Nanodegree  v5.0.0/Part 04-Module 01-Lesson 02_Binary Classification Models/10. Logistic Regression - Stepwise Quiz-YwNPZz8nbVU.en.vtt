00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.188
So I'm going to show you how I build out
my model to determine those two answers.

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:09.225
We've already built out how to connect
to the hotel loyalty data using

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:13.468
the select tool and the create samples
tool but let me build out logistical

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:18.006
regression the step wise tool and then
show you how I interpreted the results.

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:22.988
The first thing I want to do is bring
out the logistic regression yet again

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:29.080
and we'll call this whatever we really
want to but I'll call it quiz logistic.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.970
And then I'm going to select my
target field and the redeemer field.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.470
And then choose all of my different
possible predicted variables,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.300
not including the customer key, first
name, last name, and redeemer fields.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.980
After this instead of bringing out
a browse after the logistic regression,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.530
I'm going to pump this right
into the step wise tool.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.530
I'm going to name this
model quiz _stepwise.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.850
Then I'm going to keep both
the search direction and

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.530
the adjusted fit measure by default and
lastly, let me go out and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.770
browse these results and
run the workflow.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.450
Now looking at these results,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.800
we can answer the two different
questions I asked you in the quiz.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.630
The first one is which variables did
we actually remove from our logistic

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.070
regression model?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.210
And as you can see, the customer segment
field income, years of loyalty and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.860
income you we're all removed from
our logistic regression model

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.770
by our step wise tool.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.063
And as you can see,
our R squared value is 0.6096.

00:01:34.063 --> 00:01:37.546
So that's how I looked at the different
results from our step wise

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:38.570
regression tool.
