00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.290
The first results we're going to
check out are the ones coming out of

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.900
the report output.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.610
To maximize that result,
now bring it in to our window.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.045
There are many different things going
in this type of output as compared to

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:13.839
the linear.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.190
Or logistic regression or
even step-wise tool Outputs.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.530
The first thing I look at is
what is the root node error.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.940
And what this means, is when we cross
validated our data against our model.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.990
How many occur that error and
it looks like 15% errored out.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.310
So they determined that they went
to the incorrect terminal node.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.980
So what this rude node error shows us.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.750
Is of the estimation data
that we pumped in there.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.337
They size out a little sliver of and

00:00:47.337 --> 00:00:49.816
actually made their own
little validation dataset.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:55.256
Within that estimation sample and
within that validation sample.

00:00:55.256 --> 00:01:00.490
How many were predicted correctly or
actually in this case errored out?

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.643
Meaning that they went to
the incorrect terminal node, and

00:01:03.643 --> 00:01:06.050
it look like about 15%
of the records did.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.410
The next thing I look at.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.540
Is this pruning table.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.810
What this shows me is how many levels
there are to the decision tree.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.140
And some error charms with
cross-validation samples.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.820
Yet, I'm not going to go too
far in depth in the result.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.149
What I think would be more interesting
of looking at the leaf-summary and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.062
these different plots down here.

00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:31.010
Is actually flipped over
to the interactive browse.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.200
Since it does such a good job at
visualizing to help you interpret

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.460
the results from this
decision tree model.
