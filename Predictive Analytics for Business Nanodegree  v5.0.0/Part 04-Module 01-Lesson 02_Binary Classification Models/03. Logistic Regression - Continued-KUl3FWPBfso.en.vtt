00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.020
There are three different logistic
regression algorithms that

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.370
are typically used.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.550
The one we just looked
at is the default, and

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.940
it is called the logit
transformation equation.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.890
That is what we're going to
focus on in our analysis, but

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.079
let me briefly explain
the other two options.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.150
The second option is the probit
transformation equation.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.130
It looks very similar to
the logit formula and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.680
actually gives a very similar result.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.110
The third section and the last option
is the log-log transformation.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.940
This is the best option for

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.770
you if you think the percent
change in the predictor variables

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.460
will represent the percent
change in the target variable.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.300
But like I said, we're not going to
focus on these last two algorithms and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.241
rather just focus on the logit
logistic regression.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.940
For these and the other models
taught throughout the course,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.950
we're going to stay away from the math.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.810
And instead we'll focus on what the
algorithms are doing conceptually, how

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.440
to apply them, and how we can interpret
them inside the Alteryx platform.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.150
We'll be using Alteryx, because most
of the models are outside of what

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.960
typical tools like
Excel can actually do.
