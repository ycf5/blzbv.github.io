00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.600
Logistic regression is one of the most
basic forms of regression modelling.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.510
It's part of the family of generalized
linear models, or GLM, for short.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.760
Which basically means that the formula
is very similar to that of

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.080
a linear regression.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.590
However, since the target
variable is in categories

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.820
instead of a continuous
numeric variable,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.960
the target variable has to be
modified to fit this GLM formula.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.290
Let's go back and revisit that
formula from lesson one for a moment.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.930
Patrick presented the linear regression
formula that you see on the screen here.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.270
As a reminder, in this equation
y is the target variable.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.420
Beta naught is the intercept or
the baseline value and b1 or

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.170
beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, all the way to
beta n represents the coefficients for

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.450
the different variables.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.720
x1, x2, x3, all the way to xn as well.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.260
So let's compare this formula to one
of the logistic regression formulas and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.700
yep, there are actually
more than one of them.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.780
Let's first focus on the right
hand side of the equation.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.105
The right hand side of the equation is
actually identical to that of a linear

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:04.937
regression.

00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:09.046
Where again, beta naught represents
the intercept or the baseline value.

00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:14.233
Beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, all the way
up to beta n again represents

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:19.885
the coefficients of the variables x1,
x2, x3 again all the way to xn.

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:22.650
Now, what is going on the left
hand side of the equation?

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.373
Well don't be scared, this is clearly
where the logistic regression separates

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:28.470
from that of a linear regression.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.020
But actually it is
conceptually very similar.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.875
What we're trying to do is find
the probability of P which represents

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:36.120
an outcome.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.060
Like, in our example P represents the
probability of yes, they will redeem.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.490
The natural log is also in this
equation to deal with the binary nature

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.160
of this problem.
