00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.870
You just learned the fundamentals
of what a decision tree is, and

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.270
you also saw how to build and
validate your own model using Ultrix.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.880
Next we'll compare our models against
each other in order to predict

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.960
the best one for production.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.670
You may be asking yourself, why are we
comparing models against each other

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.240
if we already validated both models?

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.900
Well, I like to think that it's just
good practice to view the models

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.070
side by side.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.880
And as you're going to see,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.568
there are a couple of ways to do this
using the model comparison tool.

00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:32.290
What we're going to look for is the
overall accuracy of each of the models,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.600
as well as that lift gains chart.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.410
The lift chart is based on aggregating
data into ten different groups.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.410
These groups are ordered based on the
predictive probability of a favorable

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.000
response for the model.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.090
The response is then compared to what
would be expected if the selection of

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.370
the prospects was done randomly.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.426
Let's look at these over in Ultrix now.
