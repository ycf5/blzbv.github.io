Congratulations, you just went
through a lot of content.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.268
You learned the concepts of binary
classification modeling and

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:11.130
the backgrounds of logistic,
stepwise and decision tree models.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.370
What is just as important is
the ability to compare the models and

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.530
correctly choose which
model to use in production.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.310
Creating models is a lot of work.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.780
But being able to give your boss
prediction results that you can trust is

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.900
definitely worth the effort.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.220
Now, we're going to take a very similar
approach to building non-binary

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.630
classification models
in the next lesson.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.350
I'll see you over there.
