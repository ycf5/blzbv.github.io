00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.740
Let's switch gears and test our model
out against the validation sample

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.790
to see how well it holds up
against its independent data.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.530
So what we're going to do is
have the same model that we

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.129
already built up before in
that decision tree model, but

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.590
now we're going to plug in
the model comparison tool.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.410
We're going to configure this model
comparison tool the same way that we

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.490
did before.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.610
So the model object goes
into the M side and

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.440
the validation sample
goes into the D side.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.062
The positive class, yet
again, is going to be yes,

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:40.120
then I'm going to bring in a browse
tool, after this R, a report output.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.510
What we're able to see in
this model comparison report

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.620
is that the overall accuracy is
that 89% which is quite strong,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
but it is slightly less than
the logistic regression model.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.370
What I'm able to see
the confusion matrix yet again.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.795
How many yeses were predicted yeses,

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:03.250
and how many nos were
actually predicted nos.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.910
So yet again it seems like the yeses
were a little more difficult to predict

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.140
than the nos.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.420
This is probably because we have many
more no values than yes values, and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.920
yet again, we're going again to these
diagnostic plots a little bit later.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.710
But overall,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.250
this seems to be a very good model at
predicting this validation data set.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.250
Now the question is, which model
should we use in production to predict

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.502
who is actually likely to respond
to the marketing campaign?
