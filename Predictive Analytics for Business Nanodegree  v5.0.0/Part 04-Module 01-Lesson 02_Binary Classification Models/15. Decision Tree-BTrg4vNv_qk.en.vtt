00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.900
Now that we've learned the basic
idea of a decision tree model,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.700
let's build out one over in AlterX.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.040
What we're going to start with
is the exact same input data,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.340
a select tool, plus create samples.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.070
What I'm going to do next Is I'm
going to bring in a decision tree tool

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.210
which is found in our
predictive category.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.140
The first thing I want to do
is simply name the model.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.430
I'm going to simply call it,
DT_Redeemer.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.220
I'm then going to select what
field am I trying to target.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.630
Which is going to be
that redeemer field.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.610
And then the next thing I'm going to
do is select my different predicted

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.110
variables which will be all
the one's besides customer key,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.330
first name, last name,
and the redeemer fields.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.280
And some of the different model
customization options are found in this

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.180
tab where the first
thing that we can look

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.090
at is the minimum number of records
needed to allow for a split.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.200
So, what this means is the smaller
number that we choose here,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.960
the more splits that we're going to
have in our decision tree.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.400
And the same thing for

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.070
the minimum number for a terminal
note which is the next option.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.090
If we choose this number to go down,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.780
what we're going to have
simply more terminal nodes.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.710
These last few items
are definitely more advanced, and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.460
we're going to just keep
them simply by default.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.380
If you'd like read more on them,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.680
please just refer over to the reading
notes right below this section.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.820
So before I kick off this workflow,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.510
what I'm going to do is put browse
tools after the R and I outputs.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.670
And we're going to examine
them in the next section.
