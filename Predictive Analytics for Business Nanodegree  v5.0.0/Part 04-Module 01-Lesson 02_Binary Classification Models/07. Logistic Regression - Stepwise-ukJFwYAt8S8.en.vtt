00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.810
Wouldn't it be nice if there was
an automated way to identify

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.450
which variables are most
important to the model and

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.580
only include them in the model?

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.370
For both linear and
logistic regression, there's

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.230
a technique that does exactly this,
it's known as a stepwise regression.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.590
And the stepwise regression is a process
where variables are added and/or

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.540
removed until the best combination
of variables is identified.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.840
The stepwise algorithm
works in one of three ways.
