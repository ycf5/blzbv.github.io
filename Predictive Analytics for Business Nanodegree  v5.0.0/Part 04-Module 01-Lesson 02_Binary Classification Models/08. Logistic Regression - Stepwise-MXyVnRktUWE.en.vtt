00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.200
Let's go back to our original model,
the hotel_log1.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.670
This is where we threw all
the predictor variables

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.950
into the logistic regression trying
to predict that redeemer field and

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.190
now what we're going to do is
throw in a step wise tool.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.220
The step wise tool takes one input from
the logistic regression model object and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.270
the other input from our
original estimation data set.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.140
We now need to name what
we want to call the model

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.159
which I'll call stepwise_ log for
a logistic step wise regression.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.130
Now as you can see like
we mentioned before,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.980
there's different search directions.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.570
We can either use a backwards and
forwards search or a backwards only.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.820
By default, I'm going to choose the
backwards and forwards in combination.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.409
Now before, remember, we mentioned that
there's a couple different ways to

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.076
determine that best of the step wise
model when it should actually stop and

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:59.760
that's off of this AIC,
or the BIC values.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
AIC is generally accepted as a better
measure of model quality than BIC is,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.530
but however,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.920
the BIC is available to be used as
a quality measure if you want to.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.640
But the AIC is selected by default,
so I'm going to keep it as that.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.980
If you want to read a little
bit more about these,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.870
you can find some information about the
AIC and the BIC in the reading notes.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.006
The last thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to bring in a browse tool after

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:29.000
this step wise regression report output.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.230
Now we're going to click run and
we're going to view the output.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.790
Now what you can see in the results
is we have a very similar result

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.290
that we saw in the logistic regression.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.690
As you can see, we removed the income
field and the customer segment field,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.730
yet we kept the large
categorical variable of region.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.450
If we go to the bottom, we can see that
the r squared is quite similar to that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.090
we saw before in the full logistic
regression that we just ran, yet

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.450
we reduced many different
variables from this overall model.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.730
We still have many different variables
that are still statistically

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.800
insignificant, since they don't have
those stars over on the right hand side.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.070
Now that you see how easy it is to
build out a step wise progression,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm going to ask you to build one
out yourself in the next section.
