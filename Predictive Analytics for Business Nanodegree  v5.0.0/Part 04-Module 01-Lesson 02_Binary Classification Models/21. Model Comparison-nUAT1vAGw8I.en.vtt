00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.180
So now that we've built
out the two models,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.760
let's compare them side by side using
the model comparison tool yet again.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.150
So how we do this is we first bring in
the union tool, and connect the model

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.690
objects from both our stepwise and
our decision tree models together.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.740
Then what we do as we bring
in our model comparison tool

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.010
where the union model objects
go into the M or model side.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.610
And the validation data set
goes into the D or data side.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.300
And just like in all of our other
models, we're going to name what is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.770
a positive class we want to
have in that target variable.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.700
Which is going to be the yes responses.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.100
After this, I'm going to bring in
a browse tool after this R output and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.780
run the workflow.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.527
What I'm expecting as the results
is to see exactly the same thing in

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:56.531
the model comparison tool from our
individual models but now side by side.

00:00:56.531 --> 00:01:00.070
And the whole reason I am doing that
is it's just easier to compare the two

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.727
different models against each other
side by side rather than looking at two

00:01:03.727 --> 00:01:05.360
different windows.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.110
So let's go examine those outputs now.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.342
So the first thing like we did before
is we're going to look at that

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:12.177
accuracy report.

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:16.626
And as you can see the logistic plus
stepwise model has a 2% greater

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:20.140
accuracy than the decision tree model.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.930
But let's look at some of the other
items that are found within this report.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.580
The confusion matrix is the same
as what we saw before so

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.240
we're going to just skip over this part.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.080
Let's go over to the games chart
found in the diagnostic plots.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.860
So what the games chart is showing
me is the true response rate

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.280
on the y-axis as compared to
the rate of positive predictions.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.450
So what I simply look for
is which of the two models,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.780
the quiz stepwise represented in orange,
or the decision tree redeemer

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.030
represented in blue,
reaches the top the quickest.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.590
So this is split into different deciles,
but the only thing you really need to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.740
note here is which model
reaches the top the quickest.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.610
And which model is
overall highest the most.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.341
And what I'm able to see is that
the stepwise model from the logistic

00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:18.658
regression is a little bit higher
than the decision tree model

00:02:18.658 --> 00:02:20.165
in this experiment.

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:24.963
But as you can see, there's some
different diagnostic plots found within

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:30.080
here such as a lift chart, a precision
and recall curve, an ROC curve, etc..

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.350
I'm not going to go in depth on
any of these different types of

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.000
diagnostic plots.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.808
But there are some notes to
how to interpret them and

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:42.346
what they actually might mean
down in the reading note section.

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:47.350
What I typically take is just the gain's
chart from this diagnostic plot section.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.220
But looking at all of these, the
diagnostic plot, the confusion matrix,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.030
the Fit and error measures,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.330
overall accuracy, it looks like we have
two very good models on our hands.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.390
And evidence shows that a logistic plus
stepwise model performs slightly better

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.250
in almost every category in test.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.280
Therefore, it is the one that
I would choose to predict

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.570
who is likely to redeem deals
with future marketing campaigns.
