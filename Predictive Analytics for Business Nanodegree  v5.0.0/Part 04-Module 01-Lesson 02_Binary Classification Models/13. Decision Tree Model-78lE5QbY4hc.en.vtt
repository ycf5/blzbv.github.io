00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.340
When modeling a business problem,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.830
it's common practice to use more
than one modeling technique.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.890
Then you can compare the resulting
models to each other in order to find

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.780
which one best addresses the problem.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.120
So now that you've applied a logistic
regression to our marketing problem,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.250
we'll use the same problem to apply
a second modeling type, a decision tree.
