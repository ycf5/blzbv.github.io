00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.490
So basically what we're
trying to figure out

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.690
is how our model changes based on
removing variables from the analysis.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.250
To figure this out you just
need to remove variables

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.850
that have too many categories
within one predictor variable.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.650
So how do you actually do this?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.790
What I want to do is start with
what we've had built out already.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.310
Which is the input data tool,
connected to our select tool,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.970
which is connected to
our create samples tool.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.880
After this part, I'm going to work and
tweak our actual model.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.270
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to bring in the field summary tool

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.900
and look at the categorical
variables with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.080
how many uniques values
they have within them.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.960
What I want to do is
actually just look for

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.190
the results for
only my different categorical variables.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.976
So my customer's segment,
my income, redeemer,

00:00:52.976 --> 00:00:58.060
region, status,
region and status fields.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.640
I'm then going to bring in a browse
tool after the i or interactive result.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.970
If you look at these different
categorical variables, we can see that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.140
the customer segment income, and
region fields all have way too many

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.580
different categories to effectively use
with their logistic regression model.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.840
The way to deal with this is
either combine them into a fewer

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.460
number of groups, or we should simply
just deselect all of it for our model.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.580
So, in this situation
what I ask you to do

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.580
is if there's more than four categories.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.000
Let's just deselect and not use that
field for our logistic progression,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.900
but what I do want to notice
is that our redeemer field and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.950
status fields, those fit
the category and they're good to go.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.770
So let's now deselect
that field summary tool.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.430
I'm going to go back to our
predictive category and

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.010
bring in a logistic progression tool.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.310
Name the model and just like before
I'm going to select my target variable

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.270
as a redeemer field and then my
different potential predictor variables

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.680
which I'm going to choose as spend,
status,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.660
stays per year, total days stayed and
years of loyalty.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.050
Let me run this model now reducing
the total number of different potential

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.160
predictor variables and
let's view if the results change at all.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.460
As you can see the r squared
value is now at 0.5865.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.790
And, as well, we have three
statistically significant predictor

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.000
variables not including
the intercept value.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.210
This is definitely one very valid
way to determine the optimal

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.120
predictor variables.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.930
Yet, it is a very manual and
time consuming process.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.750
Now what we're going to do is leverage
the stepwise regression technique

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.510
to automate this process.
